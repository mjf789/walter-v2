Trait-Descriptive Adjectives\nHarrun H. Garrashi1, 2, Boele De Raad1, and Dick P. H. Barelds1\n1 Department of Psychology, University of Groningen\n2 Department of Social Sciences, Pwani University\nThis study was an endeavor to map out a personality trait structure of the Swahili language that may be used\nto develop indigenous eastern African personality assessment instruments. We followed the psycho-lexical\napproach where we not only identi\ufb01ed trait terms from the Swahili dictionary but also from free descriptions\ncollected from indigenous Swahili speakers. In combination, these two routines led to a pool of 3,732\npersonality-relevant terms, which was reduced in several steps to a set of 948 terms, identi\ufb01ed as the most\nrelevant trait-descriptive terms, including a small set of 26 adjectives, a large set of 531 nouns, and a\nsubstantial set of 391 verbs. This working set of 948 terms was lastly reduced to a\ufb01nal set of 661 most useful\nterms, converted into brief communicable sentences based on 439 nouns (comprising 250 type nouns\nand 189 attribute nouns), 199 verbs, and 23 adjectives. The list of 661 items was used to collect self and\npeer ratings from 480 university and high school students. An analysis of ratings on the 661 items revealed a\nsix-factor personality trait structure that included Virtue, Imprudence, Negative Valence, Self-importance,\nDeceptiveness, and Attentive Conversation. Separate analyses were done using the type nouns, the attribute\nnouns, and the verbs, to assess the differential contribution of these word classes to the makeup of these\nSwahili Six.\nKeywords: personality traits, trait taxonomy, psycho-lexical approach, Swahili, cross-cultural\nPersonality refers to relatively stable and partly heritable\ncharacteristics of individuals thataffect the way they feel, think,\nand behave (e.g., Eysenck & Eysenck, 1985). Numerous studies\nhave shown personality characteristics to be related to a variety of\nimportant life outcomes, such as physical and psychological health;\nquality of relationships with peers, family, and romantic others;\noccupational choice, satisfaction, and performance; and \ufb01nally\ncommunity involvement, criminal activity, and political ideology\n(for an overview, see, e.g.,Ozer & Benet-Mart\u00ednez, 2006). Not\nsurprisingly, there are several practical contexts in which the\nassessment of personality characteristics is highly relevant, such as\nthe selection of personnel, school settings, and clinical (psychologi-\ncal and psychiatric) settings.\nIn order to effectively assess relevant personality characteristics,\nit is essential to have reliable and valid standardized personality\nquestionnaires. Like other economically deprived areas of the\nworld, most African countries currently lack measures of personality\ntraits that are standardized and validated for this region. The review\non personality assessment in the French-speaking Western part of\nAfrica by Rossier et al.

This approach assumes that\nThose individual differences that are of most signi\ufb01cance in the daily\ntransactions of persons with each other will eventually become encoded\ninto their language. The more important is such a difference, the more\npeople will notice it and wish to talk of it, with the result that eventually\nthey will invent a word for it. (Goldberg, 1981, pp. 141\u2013142; cf.\nGoldberg, 1982)\nThis assumption, popularized as the\u201clexical hypothesis,\u201d implies\nthat relevant individual differences are expected to be documented\nin the natural language and that, therefore, (most of) these individual\ndifferences may be observed in a lexicon of that language. The more\nimportant an individual difference is, the more words describing\n(aspects of) this individual difference will be available. By selecting\npersonality-descriptive terms from a lexicon, administering these to\nparticipants, and then reducing these terms (usually several hundreds)\nto clusters of related terms (usually by means of factor analysis), the\npsycho-lexical approach tries to identify those personality character-\nistics that are most important (e.g.,De Raad, 2000).\nIn the few decades afterGoldberg (1981, 1982), psycho-lexical\nstudies in a variety of, especially Indo-European, languages have\nnot only independently produced inclusive word lists with trait-\ndescriptive utility but also have arrived at clusters of trait semantics\nthat fairly summarize the trait vocabularies in those languages.\nMany of those studies have taken the Big Five, suggested byTupes\nand Christal (1961, 1992) and byNorman (1963), as a reference\nmodel. The model, comprising the factors Extraversion, Agreeableness,\nConscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Intellect (Goldberg,\n1990), has since then been of great signi\ufb01cance as a medium for\ndiscussing human personality. Although the Big Five model has\nbuilt an international reputation for its usefulness in diverse contexts\nof research and application, it has also been subject of serious\ncriticisms, relating to the claim of the Big Five factors covering and\nrepresenting the entire trait domain (e.g.,Almagor et al., 1995;\nAshton & Lee, 2001; cf.De Raad & Barelds, 2008) and relating to\nits suggestion of universality (e.g.,De Raad et al., 1998, 2010).\nSaucier and Iurino (2020) recently suggested to stretch the\nextraction of factors to what seems maximally possible according to,\nfor example, parallel analysis (Horn, 1965). Such a step is of interest\nboth from a theoretical and a predictive point of view, yet does not\nagree well with the need for intelligibility and communication in the\ncontext of psychological assessment (cf.De Raad et al., 2023).\nAlthough it has been suggested that the Big Five model is cross-\nculturally tenable, this suggestion is at odds with earlier\ufb01ndings\nindicating that the Big Five factors are not all cross-culturally\nreplicable (cf.De Raad et al., 1998; Hofstee et al., 1997). About 30\nstudies have so far used the psycho-lexical approach to develop\ntaxonomies of personality descriptors in different languages, such as\nGerman, Dutch, English, Italian, French, Polish, Czech, Hungarian,\nFilipino, Korean, Spanish, Turkish, Hebrew, and Greek. The large\nmajority of these studies have focused on European languages. The\ngeneral message from these studies is that three, or at best four, of\nthe Big Five factors are replicable across European languages (De\nRaad et al., 2010). The few structures of personality that have been\nfound in non-European languages (most notably Hindi and Filipino)\nhave been found to deviate most from the Big Five model. The Hindi\nstructure (Singh et al., 2013), for example, consists of six personality\nfactors, of which three\ufb01rmly stand out. These three factors\u2014 rajasic,\ntamasic, and sattvic\u2014 bare little or no resemblance to the Big Five\nfactors, but rather re\ufb02ect the traditionaltriguna, roughly describing\npassion and energy, dullness and indifference, and goodness and\nharmony, respectively.\nThalmayer et al.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4099, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66f71046-cdf8-4b9c-904d-1635f7e2ccf5": {"__data__": {"id_": "66f71046-cdf8-4b9c-904d-1635f7e2ccf5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "385", "file_name": "demo_1.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 603348, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "63161eb1-c81d-469a-8af6-d52cba1acbdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "385", "file_name": "demo_1.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 603348, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "936af7269f6a4c6b5d0a2afaa00b288cb920454e9d5a951877278ee5c770dff3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bfe01a90-a1fa-4fed-94e4-888c00ae2180", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "385", "file_name": "demo_1.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 603348, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "80485f31e64d33974d2b5681e4288b18520acdccab7e863e4dbe64627c00fdb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4fa87fbd-45c4-41ee-b2fb-4f1925c81dbd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0da68a98ca5d4c8506984951ccdf5a79b43e52e6aa6a01c6a84c68d78d9ee7b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The large\nmajority of these studies have focused on European languages.

(2020)put two different African languages to\nthe psycho-lexical test, namely, the East African Maa, through a\nsample from the Southern Kenyan Rift Valley, and the West African\nSupyire, through a sample from the Sikasso Region of Southern\nMali. Maa belongs to the Nilo-Saharan language family, and\nSupyire belongs to the Niger\u2013Congo language family. The results\nfrom both samples emphasized differentiation along morality-\nrelated dimensions (circling around respect, or lack thereof), and\nthey provided insight in local indigenous themes such as competence,\npower, and strength. The Big Five did not emerge.Thalmayer et al.\n(2021) performed a psycho-lexical study in Khoekhoegowab, a\nlanguage spoken in Southern Africa, yet non-Bantu, with data\ncollected in Namibia. Up to levels with\ufb01ve or six factors, the results\nseem to refer to a strong evaluative theme as indicated by the Big\nOne and to a rich variety of indigenous factors with labels of which\nquite a few are certainly not alien to the trait semantics as covered by\nmodels such as the Big Five: Prosocial Diligence, for example, can\nwell be understood as a blend of Big Five Conscientiousness and\nAgreeableness, and Courage is well caught by the combination of\nBig Five Emotional Stability and Intellect (cf.Hofstee et al., 1992).\nThe \ufb01rst large-scale psycho-lexical study in sub-Saharan Africa\nwas carried out in South Africa (Nel et al., 2012), a study that\nfeatured the 11 of\ufb01cial languages of South Africa including nine\nBantu languages (Zulu, Xhosa, Swati, Tswana, Ndebele, Southern\nSotho, Northern Sotho, Tsonga, and Venda) in addition to English\nand Afrikaans. That project is characterized by an extensive\nqualitative process of cleansing (e.g., removing pure evaluative\nwords) and categorization into clusters and subclusters, ultimately\nleading to a system with nine clusters that\ufb01tted well in a six-\ndimensional structure with Big Five-related factors, with the\nAgreeableness domain captured by two factors, one describing\nPositive Social\u2013Relational traits and the other describing Negative\nSocial\u2013Relational traits (Fetvadjiev et al., 2017). The results have\nbeen used for the construction of the South African Personality\nInventory (SAPI;Fetvadjiev et al., 2015), an emic-driven tool for a\nmulticultural society.\nAn etic-driven study involving adapting a Big Five-based\ninstrument (BFI; John et al., 1991 ) to the Swahili-speaking\ncommunity in Eastern Africa only partially replicated the Big Five\nmodel while using both raw and ipsatized data (Garrashi et al., 2023).\nBased on the above results, we expect that the Big Five model\nmight not be the optimal personality model to be used in Eastern\nAfrica (in Swahili).

The wordSwahili is itself an\nArabic loanword, meaning\u201cof the coast.\u201d It is the mother tongue\n(\ufb01rst language) of the Swahili people, who live along the east\nAfrican coast stretching from southern Somalia all the way to\nnorthern Mozambique ( Appiah & Gates, 1999 ; Encyclopedia\nBritannica, 2005). Although only about15 million people speak\nSwahili as their mother tongue, Swahili is spoken as a second\nlanguage by more than 100 million people, most of whom are\nfound in eastern and central Africa ( Appiah & Gates, 1999 ;\nEncyclopedia Britannica, 2005 ). Swahili is a national and/or\nof\ufb01cial language in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. Swahili is also one of the of\ufb01cial languages\nof the African Union. At the global level, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme launched its \ufb01rst Swahili edition of\nthe Human Development Report in Kenya in 2013, thus putting\nSwahili on the path toward joining Arabic, Chinese, English,\nFrench, Russian, and Spanish, as the 7th of\ufb01cial and working\nlanguage of the United Nations. While the Swahili language has a\nnumber of local dialects, modern standard Swahili, Kiswahili\nsanifu, has its origin inKiunguja, the Zanzibar dialect.\nWhen considering the personality-descriptive potential of\nSwahili, an immediate apparent issue is its known small number\nof adjectives which at\ufb01rst sight may seem in con\ufb02ict with a feature\nof the lexical hypothesis. The main reason to focus on adjectives has\nbeen that they typically function to describe qualities of objects or\npersons. Indeed, most previous personality taxonomic studies have\nfocused on personality-descriptive adjectives (De Raad & Barelds,\n2008). While in Indo-European languages adjectives are in plenty,\ncertain languages, such as Central MexicanOtomi (Palancar, 2006),\nTibeto-Burman Jinghpaw (Kurabe, 2019), AustronesianMuna (Van\nden Berg, 1989), andSwahili, have been found to be less endowed\nwith adjectives or have no adjectives at all (cf.Dixon, 1977, 1982),\nimplying that the number of personality-descriptive adjectives is\nalso small.\nThe number of adjectives contained in the Swahili dictionary\nKamusi ya Kiswahili Sanifu(edition 2004) is counted to be about\n300 (Kahigi, 2008;c f .Lusekelo & Mpobela, 2017). That set includes\nadjectives describing qualities with no relevance for personality (e.g.,\ncolors, sizes), which would leave a rather small list of adjectives that\nmay be used for personality description. In comparison,Brokken\n(1978) identi\ufb01ed 8,690 personality-relevant adjectives in a compre-\nhensive Dutch dictionary (excluding those referring to colors, sizes,\nand such), andOstendorf (1990) identi\ufb01ed 4,827 personality trait\nrelevant adjectives in a German dictionary. In the vast majority of\nthe more than 30 psycho-lexical studies using dictionaries as trait-\ndescriptive resource, the numbers of personality-relevant adjectives\ncounted several thousands.\nThus, for the exploitation of the lexicon of the Kiswahili language\nto make its personality-descrip tive potential employable for\npersonality assessment, the class of adjectives is certainly not the\nmost promising one.\nOf the small number of adjectives that are in fact recorded in the\nSwahili dictionary, those that may seem appropriate for personality\ndescription actually must\ufb01rst be transformed into nouns before they\ncan meaningfully be used to describe a person, with the exception of\nArabic loanwords which often remain invariable. For example, the\nterm vivu (\u201clazy\u201d) is listed in the dictionary as an adjective, but in\norder to use it to describe a person, it has to be transformed into a\ntype noun by adding a pre\ufb01x M to make itMvivu (best translated as\n\u201ca lazy person\u201d), or into an attribute noun (laziness) by adding the\npre\ufb01x U to make itUvivu.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3791, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93b30664-f3c7-4f0e-bb25-43dfe53d62c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "93b30664-f3c7-4f0e-bb25-43dfe53d62c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "386", "file_name": "demo_1.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 603348, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1703127c-2fb6-4034-bf9e-8b082b34b66e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "386", "file_name": "demo_1.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 603348, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "ca611533088bce5847e427d954045921e8439d24529795ac9cc9fa71b17d63cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eca7916c-27df-4fad-ab4f-098907106ce3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "386", "file_name": "demo_1.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 603348, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "9df60de0ee9e5fc0869305070e704d73c967d24eb7d02aef36a901a07a9a5973", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b47014b-e969-48d0-9e12-f12d9ed5b018", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6fdd872e424f36ec76db23e15ec69e21f3701fd0adcedc90d0d5b6e5fbab1b6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Of the small number of adjectives that are in fact recorded in the\nSwahili dictionary, those that may seem appropriate for personality\ndescription actually must\ufb01rst be transformed into nouns before they\ncan meaningfully be used to describe a person, with the exception of\nArabic loanwords which often remain invariable.

The majority of type nouns and attribute\nnouns are provided with these pre\ufb01xes. Table 1 gives a few more\nexamples of adjective forms that have to be transformed to either of\nthe two noun forms before they can be used to talk about people.\nIn such cases where there is a scarcity of adjectives, it may be\nexpected that the adjectival-attributional function is generally dealt\nwith by other word categories such asnouns and verbs. The latter\nappears true indeed for Swahili, where person talk takes place\nespecially by using nouns as the more natural personality-relevant\nword category; the class of verbs may form a supplementary role\nin this.\nFrom language to language, psycho-lexical work seems to have\nsilently assumed that word classes can be compared directly across\nlanguages, but that is not the case (cf.Croft, 2000; Haspelmath, 2012).\nIn addition to the fact that different word classes do not contain\nwords in similar proportions across languages, the identi\ufb01cation of\nwords to belong to a certain class does not follow the same criteria.\nRestricted to Western linguistics, it was only in the 19th century that\nadjectives and nouns emancipated from the single category of\nnomen, pointing to a certain level of descriptive similarity between\nadjectives and nouns.\nThe \u201clexical hypothesis\u201d that gives direction to psycho-lexical\nstudies does, in fact, not exclude other word classes. A few psycho-\nlexically based studies have actually been performed with valuable\nresults using only nouns (e.g.,De Raad & Hoskens, 1990; Di Blas,\n2005; Henss, 1998; Saucier, 2003a) or only verbs (e.g.,De Raad et\nal., 1988; H\u0159eb\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 et al., 1999). With respect to the use of nouns\nfor personality description, one can make use of so-called type nouns\n(e.g., pessimist) or attribute nouns (e.g.,pessimism), a distinction\nmade byJohn et al. (1984, p. 85; cf. alsoAngleitner et al., 1990). Di\nBlas (2005)did a\ufb01rst study showing the relevance of attribute nouns\nfor personality-descriptive purposes.\nBecause generally other word categories may communicate trait\nmeanings as well (e.g.,patience, to procrastinate, careerist), the\nrestriction to the use of adjectives may result in a suboptimal\nrepresentation of trait semantics (Barelds & De Raad, 2015; De Raad\n& Barelds, 2008). In Hungarian, nouns and adjectives are by their\nform very often not even distinguished (Szirm\u00e1k & De Raad, 1994).\nDe Raad and Barelds (2008)have shown that the inclusion of the\ndifferent available word classes provides for a fuller coverage of\nthe trait domain.\nThe speci\ufb01c method employed to arrive at a comprehensive\npersonality vocabulary may also result in more prominent roles\nfor other word categories.

De Raad, 1985).\nThe more general issue with verbs is the transitory nature of what\nthey refer to (cf.Bolinger, 1980), which makes them often not\ufb01t\nimmediately for communicating stable characteristics of people.\nVery often, additional information is needed, in order to communicate\nits (personality relevant) meaning: To help yourself is different\nfrom to help others. A speci\ufb01c thing with using Swahili verbs for\npersonality-descriptive use is that, comparable to the use of\nadjectives, the verbs have to be provided with a pre\ufb01x. Take the\nSwahili verb foka (\u201creprimand\u201d); a person might be said to have\nthe tendency to reprimand other people and, thus, be called a\n\u201creprimanding person\u201d or \u201ca person who reprimands.\u201d In order to\nmake the wordfoka useful to communicate on the actual enduring\nphysical action of reprimanding, a pre\ufb01x ku is added to make it\nkufoka, as in the expression mtu wa kufoka (\u201ca reprimanding\nperson\u201d), or it has to undergo a more advanced transformation into\na type noun:mfokaji (\u201cone who reprimands\u201d). Very often, though,\nverbs do not reach the stage where they can play an adjectival-\nattributional role without being turned into somewhat lengthy\nand rather uncommon expressions.\nThe Swahili Culture and Personality\nIn Western cultures, personality is a virtually unavoidable concept,\na celebrated commodity in popular magazines, in furnishing career\nplanning, and in individualization of commercial products. Personal\ninitiative and individual responsibility represent important values that\nmay play a role in the appreciation of certain personality characteristics\nand may foster the articulation of distinctive personal features (cf.\nDe Raad, 2006). In non-Western cultures, personality seems to be\nmuch less central for the understanding of what motivates individual\npersons. According toTriandis (1995), for example, personality is\nless central in collectivistic cultures than in individual, Western,\ncultures. In East and South Africa, the emphasis is on interdependence\nand need for community, rather than on the individual autonomy. The\nunderlying philosophy, expressed in the concepts Utu (East African)\nand Ubuntu (Southern African), disseminates the view that each\nperson should live in accordance to the norms of af\ufb01liation and\ncompanionship, emphasizing dignity for all. This implies espousing\nsolidarity, sharing, and inclusiveness.\nAlthough Utu\u2013Ubuntu is directly translatable in humanness, or in\nbeing human, the wider tenor is that one can only be human through\nthe recognition of others, as expressed in the maxim\u201cI am well if\nyou are well\u201d(cf. Eze, 2016). According toMugumbate and Chereni\n(2020), an authentic individual human being is part of a larger and\nmore signi\ufb01cant relational, communal, societal, environmental, and\nspiritual world. Politically, Utu \u2013Ubuntu emphasizes collective\nprosperity and sharing, at the same time recognizing individual\ndifferences in capacities, talents, and potencies.\nThe Present Study\nThe goal of the present study is to develop an indigenous\ntaxonomy of Swahili personality factors that is suf\ufb01ciently systematic,\ncomprehensive, and well structured to be useful in the construction of\na personality inventory, to be used in a variety of practical settings. For\nthis purpose, we use an integrated psycho-lexical approach that\ncombined a dictionary study with a\ufb01eld study re\ufb02ecting in part the\napproach followed in the SAPI project in South Africa (Cheung\net al., 2011; Nel et al., 2012).

Guided by the Bantu belief that\u201ca person is\nonly a person through others,\u201d and hence \u201ca person perceives\nhimself/herself through the perception of others\u201d (Nel et al., 2012,\np. 920), the present study takes as its fundamental database the set of\nwords referring to individual differences that are of suf\ufb01cient social\nsigni\ufb01cance, widespread occurrence, and useful to make distinc-\ntions, to have been encoded and retained as descriptive predictors in\nthe Swahili language during the course of its development.\nAn important theme in this study is certainly the primary use of a\nlarge set of nouns in the description of personality traits, in comparison\nto the use of adjectives. For American English, for example, where\ntrait-descriptive adjectives are plenty,Rodin (1972)found that person\ndescriptions of different forms (behavioral:\u201che yells at people\u201d; trait:\n\u201che is aggressive\u201d; metaphors: \u201che is an injured alligator\u201d) differ\nin their communicational informativeness, with, of the three forms,\nbehavioral descriptions communicating most accurately and meta-\nphors least accurately. Nouns in general, and maybe indeed especially\nthose of the metaphoric type, may have a stronger persuasive\nfunction, witnessing their vast presence in the domain of personal\ninsults in various languages (e.g.,De Raad et al., 2005). Goldberg\n(1982) warned against using nouns for personality description\nbecause of their strong evaluative loading. Noun-based trait taxonomic\nstudies byDe Raad and Hoskens (1990)in Dutch,Henss (1998)in\nGerman, and Saucier (2003a) in English indeed con\ufb01rmed rather\nstrong clusters of evaluative character, but in addition, also\ndemonstrated a rich vocabulary of trait differentiation, comparable\nto what is generated by the use of adjectives. In another Dutch study\non nouns by De Raad (1992) , the data were \ufb01rst ipsatized\n(standardized per person), in order \u201cto neutralize some of the\nidiosyncrasies in using the rating scales\u201d (p. 22), with a strong\nreduction of the evaluative emphasis in the noun factors as a result.\nGiven the different unknown factors (lack of adjectives, a non-\nIndo-European language and culture), it seemed wise to follow the\nconventional tracks of the psycho-lexical approach. This involves\nthe exploitation of the Swahili language for its personality-\ndescriptive potential with an emphasis on what is quintessential to\nbe implemented in personality assessment systems, with instru-\nments based on structures such as the Big Five as referential\nexamples.\nThe present research to arrive at a comprehensive taxonomy of\nSwahili personality descriptors comprises two parts. The\ufb01rst part\n(Part 1) consists of constructing a full list of trait-descriptive terms\nthat may be considered to adequately cover the semantics of the\nSwahili personality vocabulary. In order to optimize the chances for\na full personality trait vocabulary, we not only followed the psycho-\nlexical standard by exploiting a tangible dictionary but also examined\nthe actual lexicon from where people draw to communicate about\npersonality characteristics in daily life. This\ufb01rst construction part\nconsists of three steps. The\ufb01rst step involves the extraction of trait-\ndescriptive terms from the Swahili dictionary (Kamusi).

Personality-relevant terms were generally de\ufb01ned as\nall those terms (adjectives, nouns, and verbs) that could be used\u201cto\ndistinguish the behavior of one human being from that of another\u201d\n(Allport & Odbert, 1936, p. 24). Speci\ufb01cally, we used the following\ninclusion criteria:\n1. Call a term personality descriptive if it could be used to\nanswer the following question:\u201cYeye ni mtu aina gani?\u201d\n(What kind of a person is he/she?).\n2. Call a term personality descriptive if it could be used to\ncomplete any of the following sentences:\n\u201cYeye ni mtu (ambaye)\u2026\u2026\u2026 .\u201d(He/she is a\u2026\u2026\u2026 .\nperson).\n\u201cYeye ni mtu mwenye\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u201d (He/she is a\nperson with\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ).\n\u201cYeye ni mtu anayependa/asiyependa\u2026\u2026\u2026 .\u201d(He/she\ndoes/does not [verb] frequently).\nParticipants, Procedure, and Results\nThe \ufb01rst author and two research assistants (undergraduate\nstudents both majoring in Psychology and minoring in Kiswahili, at\nPwani University in Kili\ufb01, Kenya), independently, carried out the\nculling process using theKamusi.

The four judges (from Phase 1) together\nwent through the list generated in Phase 1, and all terms that could\ufb01t\nin any of the following\ufb01ve categories, were, through consensus,\nconsidered nonpsychological traits and were therefore excluded\nfrom further analysis:\n\u0081 Physical attributes, for example, mrembo (pretty), mfupi\n(short), mnene (fat), mrefu (tall).\n\u0081 Masculine/feminine, for example, changudoa (female\nprostitute).\n\u0081 Words expressive of speci \ufb01c religious traditions, for\nexample, msalihina (prays a lot). A term like mchamungu\n(pious) would be included.\n\u0081 General terms/evaluative, for example, mbaya (bad),\nmwema (good).\n\u0081 Socioeconomic status, for example, fukara (very poor),\nmnyonge ([socioeconomically] weak), duni (low class).\nA total of 913 words were excluded using these criteria, leaving\na list of 1,143 words for further analysis. This list of 1,143 terms\ncomprised 42 adjectives, 652 nouns, and 449 verbs (seeTable 2).\nReduction Phase 3. The research team used the noun as the\nreference word when eliminating redundancy from the list, since the\nnoun had become established to be the most natural trait-descriptive\nword class in Swahili. All terms, across all word categories, touching\non a trait that had already been expressed using a noun, were excluded\nfrom further analysis. Within the class of nouns, preference was given\nto thetype noun, since through the use of a type noun a trait is more\ndirectly attached to a person and it is seen as the more natural vehicle\nto communicate on personality, while theattribute nounis generally\nmore abstract (representing ideas and concepts) and more distant from\nactual communication. For example,mwizi (thief), which is a type\nnoun, would be retained butwizi (theft; attribute noun) andkuiba\n(stealing; verb) would be excluded. This led to a further deletion of\n361 terms leaving a\ufb01nal list of 782 trait terms, of which 22 were\nadjectives (3%), 478 nouns (61%), and 282 verbs (36%; seeTable 2).\nThe results indicate that when it comes to personality trait\ndescriptors, adjectives stand at a distant third position compared to\nnouns and verbs in making up the Swahili trait vocabulary. This is\nvery unlike the Indo-European languages where adjectives form\nthe main kind of terms when talking about people\u2019s personality\ncharacteristics. As the results of the present study indicate, in\nSwahili (and possibly most Bantu languages), people describe each\nother\u2019s personality characteristics using mainly nouns, and less so\nby verbs. The results of the present study con\ufb01rm the claim byDixon\n(1977) that the Swahili language has a limited number of adjectives,\nand they bring back the question of the universality of adjectives.\nSecond Step: Free Swahili Self- and Peer\nDescriptions From the Community\nThe approach that was adopted for this second step is in part\ncomparable to that for the SAPI project. Kiswahili has different\ndialects, and the Kamusi, though considered to be the standard\nSwahili dictionary, primarily re\ufb02ecting the Zanzibar dialect, might\nmiss words used in other dialects. The free response approach aimed\nat getting personality descriptions from the community in order to\ncapture those trait terms that are not (yet) included in the Swahili\ndictionary.\nParticipants, Procedure, and Results\nThis free-description collection was carried out in Lamu, Malindi,\nand Mombasa, which are towns lying along the Kenyan coast and\nare inhabited mainly by common indigenous Swahili-speaking\npeople whose descriptions we were interested in.

The\nmajority of these Swahilis were Muslims who had attended or were\nstill attending the Islamic education system called madrasa. The group\ncomprised 138 respondents from Lamu (55% male;Mage = 35.90\nwith SD = 15.30), 137 from Mombasa (59% female;Mage = 20.28\nwith SD = 5.76), and 120 from Malindi (50% male;Mage = 25.83 with\nSD = 10.41).\nEach participant was asked to describe each of the three targets in\n10 statements: himself/herself, a person they like, and a person they\ndislike, resulting in a total of 11,850 statements (395 participants\u00d7\n3 targets\u00d7 10 statements).

Only statements that\ncontained terms that could\ufb01t the criteria speci\ufb01ed in that\ufb01rst step\nwere selected, and statements that did not depict a clear-cut trait term\nwere discarded. Also, there was a lot of similarity in the terms the\npeople used in describing each other, also giving rise to a substantial\nreduction. With these criteria, the screening of the three separate\nlists (Lamu, Malindi, Mombasa) were ultimately shortened to 643\nstatements from Lamu, 509 from Mombasa, and 686 from Malindi,\ntotaling 1,838 personality-relevant statements.

Of these 896, 23 were adjective based, 545 were noun\nbased, and 328 were verb based (seeTable 2).\nLike in the\ufb01rst step of Part 1, these 896 items were taken through\nseveral phases of screening and reduction to arrive at a useful\ufb01nal\nlist.

This set was\nscreened for clear duplicates leading to a\ufb01nal list of 948 personality-\ndescriptive terms, including 26 adjectives (3%), 531 nouns (56%),\nand 391 verbs (41%).\nFor their \ufb01nal use in a questionnaire, at this phase the 948\navailable items were put into a brief sentence format, a procedure\ncomparable to the one used byDe Raad and Barelds (2008)who\nadministered items built on different word forms (e.g., adjectives,\nnouns, verbs). Because of those different word forms, items could\nnot be listed under a single general instruction (e.g.,\u201cplease indicate\nfor each the extent to which it applies to a person\u201d), but were listed\nin sentence format, as in\u201c\u2026 an aggressive person,\u201d\u201c \u2026 someone\nwho protects people,\u201d\u201c \u2026 someone who shows jealousy,\u201d thus\nembedding adjectives, verbs, and nouns in a personality attribution.\nA corollary of this procedure, where words are put in a communicable\nsentence form, is that some of the more abstract words (adjectives,\nattribute nouns) are more easily recognized as less useful and familiar\nfor practical attributional purposes\u2014 frequency-of-use related\u2014 which\nmay be a reason to remove them (given suf \ufb01cient semantic\nequivalents). In a similar way, the variety of attributive forms in\nSwahili demanded putting each single item in a sentence format. If\none wants to use the word wivu (attribute noun forjealousy)i n\na brief item-sentence format, the noun must be preceded with a\npossessive word, thus producing a two-word expression as in\n\u201cmwenye wivu,\u201d which directly translates to English into the four-\nword expression\u201cone who has jealousy.\u201dIf one wants to usehodari\n(clever), it is turned into a three-word expression in English as in\n\u201cni mtu hodari\u201d(is a clever person). In these item-sentence formats,\nthere seems to be a tendency to use fewer words in Swahili than in\nEnglish.\nOf the still long list with 948 terms, the vast majority was\nunderstood to have clear and communicable meaning, and they\ncould easily be turned into a brief item-sentence format with two,\nthree, or sometimes four words, with the trait word being the key\nword in the sentence. In certain cases, a quali\ufb01er (in parenthesis) was\nadded to make the sentence more meaningful. For example,\u201cni mtu\nwa kutangamana\u201d (\u201cone who interacts\u201d) was provided with the\nquali\ufb01er \u201cna watu\u201d(\u201cwith others\u201d), to turn it into the more meaningful\n\u201cone who interacts with others.\u201dWith the maximum of four words for\nthe item-sentence format, quite a few terms were removed, because\nthey needed too many words to have them contained in a clear\nsentence format, often resulting in rather unusual sentences. This was\nespecially the case with verbs.\nThrough the process of conversion into meaningful, familiar, and\nbrief sentences, the list of 948 terms could thus be reduced to an\nacceptable number of 661 items to be administered for rating\npurposes.

The initial sample\nof participants consisted of 505 Swahili speakers, all from the\ncoastal areas, in particular from Kili\ufb01 and Mombasa, thus enhancing\nthe chances that Swahili is the\ufb01rst language of the participants. The\ngroup included 387 university students, four professionals, and 114\nadolescents. Of the university students, 310 were from the Pwani\nUniversity in Kili\ufb01, and 77 were from the Technical University\nof Mombasa. Both universities are public universities. The four\nprofessionals were from the Coast Professional Forum (CPF), a\ngroup that brings together all the professionals from the coastal\nregion of Kenya. The 114 adolescents (15\u201317 years old) were\nrecruited from the Majaoni Secondary School in Kili\ufb01 County.

Of the total set of 661 items, of which only 23\nwere adjective based, the primary set consisted of 250 type nouns;\nattribute nouns (of which there were 189) and verbs (199) were\nonly added when their meaning was not already represented by the\ntype nouns. Because we aimed at the fullest view possible on\nthe Swahili personality vocabulary, our primary focus was on the\nexploration of the trait-factor structure using the full set of the 661\nterms. This\ufb01rst analysis was followed by separate analyses of the\nrole the subsets may have in their contribution to the semantics of\nthe factors; moreover, because of the weight of nouns in the\nSwahili communication on personality, special attention was given\nto a combined set of type nouns and attribute nouns. Because of their\nsmall number, the adjectives are not separately analyzed. The data of\nthe subsets might allow some more insight in the roles the different\nword classes play in the makeup of the factors.Barelds and De Raad\n(2015), for example, found indication that, in Dutch, trait-descriptive\nverbs played a speci\ufb01c role in adding to the semantics of some of\ntheir (eight) factors. Yet, it must be noted that the role of especially\nthe attribute nouns and the verbs is not based on a full trait relevant\ncoverage of their word categories. In order to deal with acquiescence\nbias, all the data were ipsatized (standardized per person) before\nsubjecting them to principal component analysis (PCA) and varimax\nrotation.\nFactor Structure Based on the 661 Terms (Full Set)\nThe \ufb01rst 10 eigenvalues were 39.4, 11.6, 8.8, 7.5, 7.0, 6.3, 5.8,\n5.8, 5.7, and 5.5, explaining 16% of the total variance. In order to\nmake a selection of an appropriate and useful set of principal\ncomponents (henceforth called factors), we started with the scree\ntest, then made use of a hierarchy of factor solutions, and focused on\nsubstantial loadings of contributing trait variables, and especially\nalso on interpretability of factors. The pattern of eigenvalues (scree\nplot) suggested four to six or seven factors to capture the main\nsubstance of the trait semantics and beyond which factors will\nproduce \u201cincreasingly diminishing returns\u201d(Hofstee, 2003, p. 239).\nIn order to explore further the factor structure for this data set, we\ninspected solutions with one up to 10 factors.

The various marker\nscales are listed in theAppendix. The one dimensionality of each\nscale was examined by extracting the\ufb01rst unrotated factor based on\nthe sets of marker items. For all scales, most of the pertaining items\nloaded substantially on the\ufb01rst unrotated factor, with some scales\nhaving two and three items with loadings below a level ofj.30j.\nThose items were kept to retain the integrity of meaning of the factor\nscales of origin. The approach using items from the data set under\ninvestigation has clear shortcomings, but under the present\ncircumstances where no independent instruments were administered\nto the participants who provided the trait ratings, it was considered a\nuseful aid in the interpretation. The marker scales should not have a\ndecisive role in arriving at the best interpretation of the Swahili\nfactors, but only be used as an aid in their identi\ufb01cation and\ninterpretation. The correlations between the marker scales and the\nSwahili factors that proceeded from the eight studied factor\nsolutions are given inTable 3.I nTable 3, also the reliabilities of\nthe marker scales are given; they ran from .74 to .86.

It is the type of words that is frequently used in\ncases of breaches of social rules and may be conveyed especially\nin the form of terms of abuse (cf.De Raad et al., 2005). Considering\nthe perfect correlations across the various levels of factor extraction\n(Figure 1), the interpretation of this Factor 2/2 remains unchallenged\nwith the extraction of more factors, as shown in the Factors 3/3, 4/3,\n5/3, 6/3, 7/3, and 8/4, respectively. The patterns of correlations these\nfactors have with the marker scales inTable 3con\ufb01rm this consistent\nrecurrence.\nAt the three-factor level, the content of Factor 2/1 splits into\nFactor 3/1 and Factor 3/2. Factor 3/1 is loaded on the one pole by a\nwide array of Agreeableness-related traits such asself-respecting,\nbenevolence, courteous, trustful, compassion, andpatience, but also\nby Conscientiousness- and Intellect-related terms such as\nresponsible, discernment, and thrifty; there is a moral tone to this\nfactor. On the opposite pole, the factor is loaded by such terms as\nshow off , proud, boastful, backbiting, tormenting, bully, and\ndisorderly. Factor 3/1 could thus well be seen as a\u201cCommunion\u201d\n(Bakan, 1966) related factor, as has been observed inDeYoung\n(2006) who called it Stability; inSaucier et al. (2005), who called it\nSocial Propriety; and inDe Raad, Barelds, et al. (2018), who called it\nAf\ufb01liation. Factor 3/2 is loaded by terms expressing positive\nnonostensible moral action as injoyous, active, team player, modest,\ntruthful, takes responsibility, good-mannered, andgod-fearing; this\nis opposed to negative action as ingloomy, malignant, bad manners,\nbandit, noisy, and embarrassing. The few highest loading terms\nreferring to positive action could be understood as re\ufb02ecting an\n\u201cAgentic\u201d (Bakan, 1966) style of behavior and thus in part\ncompleting Bakan\u2019s two-factor model, or related models, though the\nfactor does not seem to be as emphatically dynamic as expressed in\nthe \u201cDynamism\u201d factors described in, for example,Saucier et al.\n(2014) and De Raad, Barelds, et al. (2018). The main gist of this\nFactor 3/2 re\ufb02ects prosocial versus antisocial activity.\nWith four factors, three remain nearly the same as those of the\nthree-factor solution, and Factor 4/4 shows an emphasis on a\ncombination of terms related to the negative poles of Big Five\nConscientiousness (e.g.,careless, lazy) and Big Five Agreeableness\n(e.g., callous, arrogant, deceptive), on the one hand. The\ndeceptiveness and callousness of this one pole is opposed to just\na few terms loading on the other pole withcautious, smiling, and\ntransparent, rather suggesting warmth and receptiveness. The factor\nmight be called Deceptiveness (vs. Receptiveness).\nWith \ufb01ve factors, Factor 4/2 has split into Factor 5/2 and Factor\n5/4. Factor 5/2 fares by traits representing Big Five Intellect (see\nalso the correlation with the I-marker scale inTable 3), mixed with\nterms describing friendly cooperation as in clever, contentious,\nopen-minded, cooperative,a n dtrustworthy as opposed to idiot,\nfeeble-minded, confused, childish,a n dignoramus. The factor\nseems to combine some aspects of sagacity and prudence on the\npositive pole, but it is especially characterized by a much larger\nnumber of items loading on the negative pole, which emphasize\nignorance, foolishness, and low intellect. Accordingly, we label\nthis factor Imprudence.

This factor solution consists of\nsix interpretable factors that also seem to carry enough substance.\nTable 4summarizes this six-factor structure, tentatively called the\nSwahili Six, with the factor labels of choice, and using maximally 25\ntrait terms per factor pole with their highest loading of minimallyj.30j\non the factor.\nThe Different Word Categories in the Swahili\nTrait Structure\nFor the present study, the two word categories of attribute nouns\nand verbs were not independently exploited to arrive at the full\ndescriptive potentials of those word categories; attribute nouns and\nverbs were only added if their meanings were not already represented\nby type nouns. The separate sets of type noun-, attribute noun-, and\nverb-based items were large enough to arrive at a fair impression of\ntheir contribution to the makeup of the six factors based on the full\nset of 661 items (the \u201cSwahili Six\u201d) and to further check the\nappropriateness of that six-factor solution. Because of their small\nnumber, adjectives were left out from this analysis. The dominant\nrole of nouns in the present study called for special attention to be\ngiven to the combined set of 439 type nouns and attribute nouns\n(second panel in Table 5). That analysis was followed by the\nseparate roles of 250 type nouns (third panel), the 189 attribute\nnouns (fourth panel), and the 199 verbs (\ufb01fth panel).\nWe \ufb01rst counted the numbers of word category-related items\ncontributing to the six full set-based factors. The \ufb01rst panel of\nTable 5gives the absolute numbers of items for each of the separate\nword categories that have their highest loading of at leastj.25j on\nthe pertaining factor of the Swahili Six. Of the 250 type nouns,\nthere were 141 such items, of which most loaded substantially on\nVirtue (49 items) and on Negative Valence (50 items).

The \ufb01rst 10 eigenvalues in case of\nthe 189 attribute nouns were 15.2, 5.3, 4.2, 3.5, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 2.9, 2.9,\nand 2.7, with six factors explaining 18.3% of the total variance.

There were\nvirtually no relations between the 661-based factors F6/3 and F6/5\non the one hand and any of the verb-based factors on the other hand.\nThe 661-based factor F6/4 (Self-importance) seems best related to\nthe 199-based F6/1 factor.\nThe Meaning of the Six Factors Caught in Swahili\nConcepts, and the Role of Word Class\nThe interpretations of the six factors based on the full set of 661\nitems have been done in terms of what has been found elsewhere\nin the lexical literature, but suchinterpretations (summarized in\nTable 4) might be more or less alien to the Swahili language and\nculture. Because of this, we provide a parallel Swahili interpretation,\nin terms of somewhat abstract or even philosophical wordings. The\ndiscussion of the word classes in the makeup of the factors is\nrestricted to the single word classes, type nouns, attribute nouns,\nand verbs.\nThe \ufb01rst factor(F6/1), de\ufb01ned by terms such asrespectful, active,\nand careful as opposed to evil-minded and confrontational, and\ncalled Virtue\u2014 with a slight agentic tone\u2014 is expressed through all\nthree word classes, but strongest through attribute nouns, followed\nby type nouns and then verbs. In Swahili this factor could be\ncalled Wema, which stands for goodness, kind-heartedness, moral\nexcellence, integrity, and virtue, all characteristics that come close to\nthe central meaning of what is called Utu in Swahili, expressing\nthe Swahili philosophy on human relationships. The Swahili Utu is\nsimilar to the Ubuntu philosophy found in Southern Africa,\nespecially among the Bantus ( N e le ta l . ,2 0 1 2), and directly\ntranslatable into humaneness.

The factor fares by traits representing the\nBig Five Intellect dimension, with a relatively large set of terms on\nthe negative pole such asidiot, feeble-minded, confused, childish,\nfoolish, andignoramus, as opposed to thepositive pole describing\nmindful cooperation as inclever, self-regarding, open-minded, and\ncooperative. The factor has indeed its strongest correlation with the\nIntellect marker scale (Table 3). In the Swahili culture, a person who\ncannot make wise decisions is referred to as weak-minded and\nbrainless. This factor may capture that inability of persons to use\ntheir minds and make sound decisions in the social domain, as\nopposed to those who act wisely and demonstrate prudence. In\nSwahili this distinction is captured by the pair of termsUbahaluli\nversus Busara.A Bahaluli is indeed a foolish,\u201cbrainless\u201d person,\nsomeone who shows inability to act wisely (kukosa busara).\nThe third factor(F6/3), called Negative Valence (NV;Almagor\net al., 1995), de\ufb01ned by such terms as mugger, crazy, corrupt,\nwater-headed idiot, foulmouthed, and mischievous, is loaded by\ntype nouns only. The factor correlated strongest (seeTable 4) with\nboth the NV marker scale (.36) and the I-marker scale (\u2212.34). The\nMalignity and Social Unacceptability semantics of this factor,\ncombined with its emphatic expression through type nouns, may\nput the factor in a context of restorative or corrective verbal\ncommunication (cf.De Raad et al., 2005). The Swahili version of\nthe concept is captured byUwi, capturing traits that work against the\nspirit of Utu.\nThe fourth factor(F6/4), called Self-importance, and de\ufb01ned by\nsuch terms asproud, boastful versus trustworthy and attentive,i s\nmost expressed through verbs and attribute nouns. The Swahili\nexpression for this isKibri (literally: arrogance). Among the Swahili\nspeakers, a person who feels very important and behaves arrogantly\nis said to haveKibri.\nThe \ufb01fth factor(F6/5), called Deceptiveness (vs. Receptiveness)\nand de\ufb01ned by such terms asdeception, callous, and parasite,a s\nopposed to smiling, open, and affectionate is expressed typically\nthrough attribute nouns. Moreover, factoring only attribute nouns,\nthe pertaining 661-based factor is fully reproduced. This factor does\nnot substantially relate to any of the marker scales.

We \ufb01rst conducted two qualitative studies\nwhere we identi\ufb01ed trait-descriptive terms from both the Swahili\ndictionary (Kamusi) and free self and peer descriptions. From the\nKamusi, we managed to generate a list of 782 Swahili terms that\ncould be used to describe peoples\u2019traits. From the free descriptions,\nwe were able to identify 391 trait terms.

Although we acknowledge that\nboth the interpretation of factors and the decision on the appropriate\nnumber of factors are inherently subjective, we decided on a six-\nfactor structure with the factor labels Virtue, Imprudence, Negative\nValence, Self-importance, Deceptiveness, and Attentive Conversation,\nin that order.\nThe Swahili equivalents for the six dimensions would be\nWema, Ubahaluli, Uwi, Kibri, Una\ufb01ki, and Muamala, respectively,\nsummarized as the Swahili Six, an interesting amalgamation of new\nfactors and factors from already known models, that have been\ndiscovered elsewhere. The Virtue factor compares to the Virtue\nfactor from the Dutch eight-factor structure (De Raad & Barelds,\n2008) and the Social Self-regulation factor of Saucier \u2019s basic\nbivariate structure (Saucier et al., 2014). The Imprudence factor\ncompares to, and actually correlates substantially with, the Big Five\nIntellect marker scale. Our Negative Valence factor compares to\nthe NV factor of Tellegen and Waller (Almagor et al., 1995, or the\nSaucier, 2003b). Our Self-importance factor compares to the\nnegative pole of the Honesty\u2013Humility factor ofAshton and Lee\u2019s\n(2007) model. The correlation of the Honesty\u2013Humility marker\nscale with Self-importance con\ufb01rms that relationship, but with the\nmain load on the negative pole the factor may better be considered\nas a somewhat narrow version of Narcissism (cf.De Raad, Nagy, et\nal., 2018). The Deceptiveness andAttentive Conversation factors\nseem to deal with trustworthiness and thoughtfulness facets in social\nintercourse, neither of the two being identi\ufb01ed by any of the marker\nscales.\nWith this\ufb01nding, we turn to some obvious other questions, such\nas \u201ccan the Big One be identi\ufb01ed\u201d in the Swahili trait vocabulary,\nand the Big Two, the Big Three, and so forth? Regarding the Big\nOne, the conclusion seems obvious: the\ufb01rst unrotated factor (F1/1)\ncaptures largely evaluative meaning or social desirability. A solution\nwith two factors, of which the\ufb01rst (F2/1) is quite similar to F1/1, and\nof which the second (F2/2) was concluded to capture Negative\nValence, does not show any similarity with the Big Two, with its\ndistinctive Agentic and Communal features. Only with three factors,\none could, next to the recurrent NV factor in F3/3, discern\ncommunal aspects in F3/1 and agentic aspects in F3/2. It should be\nadded, though, that the communal-agentic distinction in these two\nfactors is far from articulate. A factor covering order or structure or\neven Conscientiousness, to enable the possibility of the three-factor\nmodel, is hard to\ufb01nd in any of the studied factor solutions. The Big\nFive were not identi\ufb01ed; at best one could appreciate Imprudence,\nre\ufb02ecting Intellect, and in the combined set of the three factors Self-\nimportance, Deceptiveness, and Attentive Conversation, one might\nobserve difference aspects or facets of Big Five Agreeableness.\nThe results could therefore be an indication of the existence of an\nalternative six-factor structure that may be unique to Eastern African\nSwahili cultures.\nBecause of the reported Arabian in\ufb02uences, with the consequence\nof Arab loanwords in the Swahili lexicon, one might surmise\npossible Swahili-Arabic connections in terms of trait structure.

The talkative, cheerful,\nactive, outgoing, energetic person, easily identi\ufb01able through most\npersonality trait vocabularies in many languages, is not a typical\npedestrian on Swahili streets. This may well be taken as a sign that\nthose streets are paved in a collectivistic-oriented culture. This\nrelative absence of typical extraverted behavior is not a matter of\npoverty, but rather a matter of priority and value. In Swahili culture,\nthe Utu (Ubuntu) maxim\u201ca person is well when others are well\u201d\napplies. \u201cThe collectivistic identity is de\ufb01ned in terms of relation-\nships to others\u201d(Ma & Schoeneman, 1997). People in collectivistic\ncultures place greater value in social alliance and being committed\nto group goals than those who live in individualistic cultures, and\nthey may therefore be less preoccupied in celebrating the self-\nenhancing tendencies that seem to be most typically expressed in\nextraversion-related traits (cf. Arpaci et al., 2018; Church et al.,\n2006; Heine, 2001; McCrae & Allik, 2002; McCrae & Terracciano,\n2005; Triandis, 1995).\nMost striking about the Swahili Six is the strong emphasis on\nvalue and morality loaded factors, seemingly re\ufb02ecting traits that\nexpress the importance of collective goals. The morality contents of\nthose factors also emerged quite strongly in Thalmayer et al.\u2019s\n(2020, 2021) studies in Mali, Kenya, and Namibia. In the SAPI\nproject, much of the morality content seemed to have been removed\n(pure evaluative items) or accommodated in subclusters (e.g.,\nHostility), and the remainder was \ufb01nally brought to terms with\nSocial\u2013Relational factors. Factors with similar contents have\nrepeatedly been found in other lexical studies (referred to as\nVirtue, Evaluation, Negative Valence). The Virtue factor in Swahili,\nits \ufb01rst and strongest factor, tells which are desirable traits and\nwhich are undesirable traits with respect to what binds the community.\nThe second factor, Imprudence, captures traits that indicate that\nsomething is understood to be clearly wrong in the minds of people.\nIn Swahili, the term intellect signi\ufb01es both power of the mind\n(intelligence or wisdom) and manners.\u201cKukosa akili\u201d(imprudence)\ncan mean either lack of wisdom or bad manners. Those people are\nridiculed through the use of behavioral words (verbs) or through\nwords of insult (type nouns), almost excusing their inability to\nunderstand and participate in realizing shared goals. The third factor,\nNegative Valence, captures a great variety of traits, but all conveying\nthe extent to which a person is considered worthless or even harmful\nwith respect to what is cherished in the community. The words that\nare used in this regard are almost all of the disdainful type, carried\nthrough type nouns. The contents of the fourth factor, Self-\nimportance, re \ufb02ecting a rather recurrent facet of personality\nemerging in quite a few different languages, either as subdomain\nof (dis)Agreeableness or as central theme of the negative pole of\nHonesty\u2013Humility, may be seen as blasphemous in the collectiv-\nistic context.

This may\nbe somewhat surprising, given the fact that a study examining a\nSwahili version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI;John et al., 1991)\nfailed to replicate the\ufb01ve factors in the BFI and also found just\npoor to moderate scale reliabilities for the Swahili BFI scales\n(Garrashi et al., 2023).

Moreover, the identi\ufb01ed sets of\nitems per marker scale do not all cover the different facets of the\noriginals. The marker scale for Extraversion, for example, is rather\nnarrow in semantics with repeated terms expressing chat and joy.\nThere may indeed be marker words in Swahili to represent traits\nfrom different models, but this does not mean that both those\nmodels and Swahili fully and mutually represent each other \u2019s\ncultural and lingual semantic speci\ufb01cs.

This\ufb01ts our explanation\nthat the Big Five factors may play a less important role in the\ncollectivistic East African culture examined here than the reported\nvalue and morality-oriented lexical Swahili factors. The resulting\nrelatively small selection of Big Five-related terms in Swahili\nmakes it less likely for those factors to emerge.\nType nouns play a big role in the semantic make up of all factors,\nexcept of the Deceptiveness factor, which is, in Swahili, almost\nexclusively communicated through the more abstract attribute\nnouns.

The length of the questionnaire was\nresponded to by allowing a week time before returning it; the lack of\nfamiliarity may have caused a certain amount of noise.\nAlthough we decided on a structure with six factors in the present\nstudy, which is a relatively common number of factors in lexical\nstudies (e.g.,De Raad et al., 2010), the percentage of variance that\nwas explained by these six factors was quite low (16%), meaning\nthat the majority of the variance in the present study\u2019s variables is\nnot accounted for by the\ufb01nal six-factor structure. This percentage of\nexplained variance is also relatively low in comparison to other\nlexical studies (e.g.,De Raad & Barelds, 2008). There are several\npotential causes for\ufb01nding a low percentage of explained variance\nin exploratory factor analyses, such as the number of variables\nanalyzed, the number of factors extracted, the composition and\nsize of the sample, and the number of scale categories used\n(Peterson, 2000).\nFor example, the larger the number of variables analyzed, and\nthe larger the sample size, the lower the percentage of variance\naccounted for (Peterson, 2000). Also, the variance accounted for\ntends to be a bit lower in student samples. In the present study, we\nanalyzed a large number of variables (661), in a substantial sample\n(480), consisting mostly of students. This may explain why the\npercentage accounted for was quite low. In addition, the previously\nmentioned limitation that the current sample lacks experience when\nit comes to\ufb01lling out (lengthy) questionnaires may have introduced\nerror variance that in turn negatively affected the percentage of\nvariance accounted for in the factor analyses.\nAn issue in need of further investigation is the use of language\nthat has hardly adjectives to communicate on personality. Together\nwith the distinctive factor results in a psycho-lexically new\nlanguage, a question is whether the results should be attributed\nto a unique feature of the language, to the African cultural context, or\na combination of such characteristic.\nConclusion\nIn this study, we followed the psycho-lexical approach in order\nto map out the implicit personality trait structure in the Swahili\nlanguage. The results concluded to a six-factor structure in Swahili,\nthe Swahili Six, including Virtue (Wema), Imprudence (Ubahaluli),\nNegative Valence (Uwi), Self-importance (Kibri), Deceptiveness\n(Una\ufb01ki), and Attentive Conversation (Muamala). Our study has\nalso indicated that the Big Five factor model was not con\ufb01rmed,\nneither was the six-factor HEXACO model.\nThis is the\ufb01rst study that has applied a pure emic approach to\nexplore the personality structure of Eastern African Bantu in sub-\nSaharan Africa (excluding South Africa). It is also one of the very\nfew studies to combine a dictionary approach study with a free-\ndescription approach in exploring the personality trait vocabulary in\na language. And it is the\ufb01rst study to our knowledge studying trait\nlanguage that hardly contains the trait typical adjective. The\ninteresting but rather deviant results requires further investigation of\nthe Swahili personality structure, in comparison to other languages,\nand taking into account, among other things, the role of word\ncategories and the dimension individualistic versus collectivistic.\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nSWAHILI TRAIT STRUCTURE 399", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3225, "end_char_idx": 7449, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5edc95d9-0c26-449e-a31d-da084e91c7c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "5edc95d9-0c26-449e-a31d-da084e91c7c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "400", "file_name": "demo_1.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 603348, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d6719bd-b1a7-4c6c-aff5-42cda6b68112", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "400", "file_name": "demo_1.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 603348, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "3e4949a3b7b5c35bace1ae5e153d8742510fe77338d35a8d37f350bd3653b445", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "77b3068f-c5dc-4de0-adc9-a77a897b69ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7db781c588ee420421ba2feef6ca66467b5268aa48ff1c156afc923134761450", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "References\nA standard English-Swahili dictionary , founded on Madan \u2019s English-\nSwahili dictionary.

We assume that\necologically, negative person attributes are more diverse than positive ones, while positive person attributes\nare more frequent than negative ones. We combine these ecological properties with the cognitive process of\nsimilarity- and differences-based social comparisons to predict temporal self-appraisals. The resulting\ncognitive\u2013ecological model predicts that people should evaluate similarities with themselves over time\npositively, whereas differences would be evaluated more negatively. However, because positive attributes\nare reinforced over time relative to negative attributes, we predicted an asymmetry to emerge such that\ndistinct attributes of the past self (past differences) would be most negative. Six experiments (totalN =\n1,796) and an integrative data analysis con\ufb01rmed the cognitive\u2013ecological model\u2019s predictions for temporal\nself-appraisals. However, we found no evidence for motivated self-perception across time. We discuss the\nimplications of these\ufb01ndings for temporal self-appraisal theory and other aspects of self and identity.\nKeywords: temporal self-appraisal, temporal comparison, information ecology, self and identity, self-\nenhancement\nSupplemental materials: https://doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000369.supp\nWe all have our time machines, don\u2019t we? Those that take us back are\nmemories, and those that carry us forward are dreams.\n\u2014 \u00dcber-Morlock, The Time Machine\nFrom philosophy to folk beliefs, the subjective progress of time is\nessential to the concept of the self. In fact, Heidegger (1962)\ncontended that existence and time are one and the same\u2014 people are\nthrown into a stream of possibility, stretched between birth and death\nby their awareness of having been in the past and their ability to\nproject themselves into the future. Accepting their place in time is a\nlife-long project for people (Bluck & Levine, 1998; Habermas &\nBluck, 2000), and mentally traveling back and forth between\nmemories of the past and dreams of the future is fundamental to how\npeople construct an identity that has purpose, signi\ufb01cance, and\ncoherence (McAdams & McLean, 2013; McAdams & Pals, 2006).\nHere, we examine some basic principles of evaluating oneself over\ntime. We rely on a cognitive\u2013ecological approach to evaluative\ninformation processing (Alves et al., 2017a, 2017b, 2019; Fiedler,\n2000) to examine the nature and consequences of comparing the self\nacross time. Speci\ufb01cally, we examine how the evaluative informa-\ntion ecology (EvIE; Unkelbach et al., 2019, 2020) shapes self-\nevaluations based on temporal comparisons.\nTemporal Comparisons\nComparison is a building block of human social life (Festinger,\n1954), in\ufb02uencing domains as diverse as stereotyping (Biernat, 2003),\nperson perception (Herr, 1986; Higgins & Lurie, 1983), attitudes\n(Sherif & Hovland, 1961), and affect (Epstude & Mussweiler, 2009).\nBroadly speaking, people compare information to an available\nstandard whenever it is perceived, processed, or evaluated (Kahneman\n& Miller, 1986). And although other mammals engage in comparative\nthinking and exhibit rudimentary displays of social comparison\n(Dumas et al., 2017; Keupp et al., 2019; Schmitt et al., 2016; J. Suls et\nal., 2019), humans are probably exceptional in their ability to compare\nthemselves across time (Suddendorf & Busby, 2003).

In the following sections, we\nsummarize some key points of Albert\u2019s temporal comparison theory\nand review some of the more recent research inspired by his work.\nSelf-Continuity Motive\nBorrowing from Festinger\u2019s language,Albert (1977)hypothesized\nthat people compare the present self to the past self to maintain an\nenduring, coherent, and integrated identity over time. Thus, people\nwould strategically compare with past selves that are consistent with\ntheir current selves; that is, to focus on similarities between the\npresent and the (recent) past. A primary thesis fromAlbert\u2019s (1977)\nwork was that the drive for these kinds of comparisons would be\nparticularly strong during times of change when one\u2019s sense of an\nenduring self-concept would be threatened.\nThese ideas are generally supported by research showing that people\nrely on their autobiographies as a guide for integrating unexpected\nevents into a coherent story, and asa way to interpret change, especially\nto maintain continuity (Bluck et al., 2005). When people experience\ncertain events separating a desired future from the present, they appear\nto be motivated to close this gap intime by pursuing goals that align the\npresent with the future self (Peetz & Wilson, 2013). Other research\nshows that speci\ufb01c types of past comparisons are utilized when faced\nwith feelings of discontinuity. For instance, people report feeling more\nnostalgic when self-continuity isthreatened, and recalling nostalgic\nmemories can promote self-continuity in the face of those threats\n(Sedikides et al., 2016).\nHowever, other observations contradict the notion that people are\ndriven by a general need for continuity and that temporal comparisons\nwork to satisfy this need. For instance, when comparing past and future\nselves, people tend to treat those selves as\u201cothers\u201d and exhibit typical\nactor\u2013observer effects when evaluating them (Pronin & Ross, 2006). If\npeople are motivated to see the self as one coherent whole, one must\nwonder why past and future selves are experienced as\u201cothers.\u201d Also,\npeople do expect to change over time, and in particular, expect to\nchange for the better (O\u2019Brien & Kardas, 2016). In fact, explicit self-\ndiscontinuity sometimes promotes positive outcomes, as research on the\nfresh start effect attests (Dai & Li, 2019). When a temporal landmark\nsigni\ufb01es the beginning of a new period, people tend to be more\nmotivated to pursue new goals, partly because they feel disassociated\nfrom the past. People have also been shown to strategically use temporal\nlandmarks\u2014 creating temporal discontinuity between the present and\nthe future to maintain a positive self-view (Peetz & Wilson, 2014).\nThese \ufb01ndings suggest that comparingacross time can also serve\nthe function of self-enhancement, even at the cost of self-continuity\n(i.e., when considering differences in the self across time).\nSelf-Enhancement Motive\nAlthough Albert (1977)was mostly silent on the idea that temporal\ncomparison can serve the purpose of self-enhancement, research\ninspired by his work has focused on this function. Most people are\ninclined to feel good about themselves (Baumeister, 1999; Leary,\n1999; Sedikides et al., 2003). This tendency is often described as a\nmotive\u2014 people strive to hold themselves in high regard, so much so\nthat they often deceive themselves into believing that they are good\neven when objective evidence is lacking or contradictory (Ditto &\nBoardman, 1995; Doosje et al., 1995; Ryff, 1991; Tesser, 1988).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3972, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4670b635-e739-4a48-ab6b-c4b24fe96d7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4670b635-e739-4a48-ab6b-c4b24fe96d7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "780", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8928522-8109-49e3-a0e3-e00134a92fa0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "780", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "a69bab02a2af9a28bd2f382e573e11e240cd63d78e9d1e1cb4866d09dd48e537", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8b6256b-1273-4542-8cc4-150c86c08690", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "780", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "f9821ef05f7bd0975a1fdb85ff860380fcae57775eec01e310ad9bc4037d9944", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Self-Enhancement Motive\nAlthough Albert (1977)was mostly silent on the idea that temporal\ncomparison can serve the purpose of self-enhancement, research\ninspired by his work has focused on this function.

M. Suls & Miller, 1977).\nThe temporally extended nature of the self interacts in interesting\nways with the self-enhancement motive because the question facing\nindividuals might be which self to enhance at what point in time. One\nway to deal with this problem might be to decide that one has always\nbeen good and only focus on those similarities over time; such a\nstrategy would boost and maintain self-regard and satisfy the need\nfor self-continuity. According to other comparison models, such an\noutcome could be achieved by testing how the present is similar to the\npast self (Mussweiler, 2003), which would promote including the\npast self into the present self (Bless & Schwarz, 2010). One could\nexaggerate the positivity of these stable features and then assimilate\nthem into the present self-concept. However, when considering\nthe temporal nature of the self, people also tend to expect self-\nimprovement (O\u2019Brien & Kardas, 2016). As the presented research\nsuggests, people sometimes feel that they are not, or have not always\nbeen good, and will strategically contrast away from negative temporal\nselves in service of self-enhancement (Peetz & Wilson, 2013, 2014).\nThus, rather than self-enhance by focusing on stable positive\nqualities of the self over time, people may look for ways that they have\nchanged or will change for the better. This particular self-evaluation\nhas now been covered extensively by temporal self-appraisal theory\n(Ross & Wilson, 2000, 2003; Wilson & Ross, 2000, 2001), which\nproposes that people self-enhance by disparaging distant past selves\nwho have little bearing on the present self, speci\ufb01cally, those that are or\nfeel distant in time. Building on the self-enhancement tradition, the\ntheory argues that this process is motivated and sometimes deceptive.\nEven when no actual improvement has occurred, people seem to\nassume that their past selves were worse (Wilson & Ross, 2001).\nToward an Alternative Account\nThere is strong evidence for this motivated self-perception across\ntime. However, we aim to suggest and test an alternative explanation\nfor temporal self-appraisal effects. Speci\ufb01cally, we build on recent\ninsights summarized in the EvIE model (Unkelbach et al., 2019;s e e\nalso Unkelbach et al., 2020), which describes how the information\necology is structured regarding its evaluative properties. Temporal\nself-appraisal theory describes a comparative evaluation process\nacross time. We thus combine the ecological properties with the\ncognitive process of self-comparisons, resulting in a cognitive\u2013\necological model of temporal self-comparisons. In the following, we\ndescribe the basic premises of this model and then apply this model to\ntemporal self-appraisals.\nThe Ecological Side: The Evaluative Information Ecology\nThe EvIE model suggests two structural properties of positive and\nnegative information: positivity prevalence and negativity diversity.\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\n780 BALDWIN, ALVES, AND UNKELBACH", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3352, "end_char_idx": 7432, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15d3f08f-4d09-4caf-8298-10cc3076aa9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "15d3f08f-4d09-4caf-8298-10cc3076aa9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "781", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4aa0ba0f-778d-4191-a251-f54fb94f4f05", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "781", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "fec22a24640217a1b590b50825447f34df6aaf353a6395c40e9e38ae95f8caad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2da3677d-7aac-4579-bc2a-7e1dcab523b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "151e636b457702a46008dacb6099ad3fbecf5a0334b1688881d779c65e5962a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "First, positive information, such as words, traits, behaviors, events, or\nobjects, occurs more frequently than negative information. Positive\nwords are used more frequently in written and spoken language,\npeople usually expect others to behave positively, and the positivity of\npersonality traits strongly correlates with their prevalence (Alves et al.,\n2017b; Wood & Furr, 2016). In short, the social world is mostly\npositive most of the time (seeUnkelbach et al., 2019, 2020,f o r\nsummaries). Second, although positive information is more frequent,\nnegative information is more diverse (Alves et al., 2017b). There are\nmore ways to be negative than to be positive, and this greater diversity\nof negativity is visible at various levels of observation and across many\nstimulus domains. For example, there are more unique words to\ndescribe negative things or negative people, and these negative words\nare less similar to one another. The same holds true for other stimuli\nsuch as faces, affective images, life events, and emotional reactions\n(Unkelbach et al., 2019). The reasons for liking something (e.g., ice\ncream) or somebody (e.g., a famous actor) are also highly similar,\nwhile there are many reasons to dislike something or somebody\n(Gershoff et al., 2007; Leising et al., 2013).\nThe Cognitive Side: Comparisons\nThese properties have a probabilistic in\ufb02uence on comparison\nprocesses. Most notably, the ecological properties create a world\nwhere positive attributes are usually shared, whereas negative\nattributes are usually distinct. The reverse is also true: Shared\nattributes are usually positive, whereas distinct attributes are usually\nnegative (Alves et al., 2017b, 2018). In other words, attributes that\ndifferentiate people, groups, or objects are usually negative, and\nthose that they share are usually positive. We will illustrate this\nprinciple in more detail below (seeFigure 1). The implication is that\nany comparison process highlighting distinct rather than shared\nattributes tends to highlight the negatives, which may result in\n\u201cbiased\u201d attitudes. For example, the fact that novel groups are\ntypically judged based on attributes that differentiate them from\nfamiliar groups can explain why people often hold negative attitudes\ntoward out-groups and minorities (Alves et al., 2018). The same\nholds for comparing people: When two people are compared based\non what they share, positive attributes will come to mind, but when\ncompared based on what they do not share, negative attributes will\ncome to mind (Alves et al., 2017a; Unkelbach et al., 2019).\nThe research program just summarized focuses primarily on social\ncomparison between different individuals or groups. In the current\nresearch, we aim to apply this ecological perspective to temporal\ncomparisons of the self and pave the way for new predictions\nregarding the evaluation of the self across time.\nThe Information Ecology Across Time\nWe now apply the EvIE assumptions to temporal comparisons\nand delineate the implications of these assumptions for the outcomes\nof temporal comparisons. Crucially, we extend the model by a\ntemporal factor; beyond frequency and diversity, we add a growth\ncomponent over time.Table 1summarizes the three principles of the\nEvIE and how they might extend to the temporal domain.\nThe novel growth principle assumes that positive attributes of an\nindividual will be reinforced over time, whereas negative attributes\nwill not. From a young age, on average, children are taught what is\ngood and what is bad; positive behaviors and attributes grow\nstronger through reward and praise, whereas negative behaviors and\nattributes are weakened through punishment and lack of reinforce-\nment. This means that people, on average, gain and maintain\npositive attributes at a greater rate over time relative to negative\nattributes. It feels good to be good, to learn, and to improve, and it\nfeels bad to fail and decline (Denrell, 2005; Langston, 1994; Nevin\n& Grace, 2000; Reis et al., 2010; Unkelbach et al., 2019).\nThe hedonic aspect of temporal self-comparisons is built into\nthe growth principle.

We elaborate on this in the next section, starting with a\nmore thorough translation of the EvIE model to temporal comparisons.\nThe Temporal Evaluative Information Ecology\nAgain, in general, positive attributes are more prevalent and less\ndiverse than negative attributes (seeTable 1; frequency and diversity\nproperties). These properties imply that when two people are\ncompared, their shared attributes are likely to be positive, and those\nthat differentiate them are likely to be negative. For temporal self-\ncomparison, it should follow that at any two points in time, attributes\nthat have remained the same over time (i.e., that the present and past\nself share) are likely to be positive, and attributes that have changed\nare likely to be negative.\nTo illustrate this argument,Figure 1 visualizes attributes in the\nEvIE with a simple attribute present/absent logic (Alves et al.,\n2017a; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The left part illustrates the\nfeature vectors of a person\u2019s past and present selves. The vector\nentails different positive and negative attributes that can either be\npresent (\ufb01lled boxes) or absent (un\ufb01lled boxes) in the past and\npresent selves. For our argument, it is irrelevant whether the feature\nvectors refer to the self\u2019s actual attributes or to a person\u2019s mental\nrepresentation of the same.\nThe frequency and diversity asymmetries are implemented in the\nattribute vectors. There are twice as many positive as negative\nattributes present in the two selves (i.e., positive information is\nprevalent). The negative attribute vector is twice as long as the\npositive vector, meaning that the self could have more negative\nattributes (i.e., negative information is more diverse).\nConsequently, any positive attribute has a higher probability of\nbeing present in a given self than any negative attribute, here:p(present|\npos) = 0.80; p(present|neg)= 0.20. This also means that any positive\nattribute has a higher probability of being shared by past and present\nselves, here:p(shared|pos)= 0.80 \u00d7 0.80 = 0.64, than any negative\nattribute,p(shared|neg)= 0.20 \u00d7 0.20 = 0.04. Conversely, positive and\nnegative attributes have the same probability of being distinct for either\nthe past or present self,p(distinct|pos)= 0.80 \u00d7 0.20 = 0.16;p(distinct|\nneg) = 0.20 \u00d7 0.80 = 0.16. Hence, positive attributes are more likely\nshared than distinct (here: 0.64 vs. 0.16), while negative attributes are\nmore likely distinct than shared (here: 0.16 vs. 0.04).\nImportantly, the relation between attribute valence and shared-\nness also exists in the other direction. That is, shared attributes tend\nto be positive, and distinct attributes tend to be negative. Again,\nusing the base rates ofFigure 1, the mean number of shared positive\nattributes is 10\u00d7 0 \u00d7 0.64 = 6.40, and the mean number of shared\nnegative attributes is 20\u00d7 0.04 = 0.80. Hence, among shared traits,\nthe positivity prevalence of the ecology (2:1) is ampli\ufb01ed among\nshared attributes (8:1). Among distinct attributes, the mean number\nof positive attributes is 10\u00d7 0.16 = 1.60, and the mean number of\nnegative attributes is 20 \u00d7 0.16 = 0.32. Hence, the ecological\npositivity prevalence (2:1) is attenuated among distinct attributes\nand, for the example ofFigure 1\u2019s base rates, even reversed (1:2).\nIn summary, assuming that the information ecology shows\npositivity prevalence and negativity diversity, it follows that if an\nattribute is positive, it is likely to be shared between the past and\ncurrent self. If an attribute is shared between the past and current\nself, it will likely be positive. Conversely, a negative attribute will\nlikely be a distinct attribute of the past or present self.

For\nexample, when people form associations between categories and\ntheir attributes, more attention and weight are given to attributes that\nheighten between-category differences rather than between-category\nsimilarities (Krueger & Clement, 1994; Krueger et al., 1989).\nDistinct attributes tend to de\ufb01ne a category (Tversky & Gati, 2004).\nAssuming these processes also apply to temporal comparisons, it\nfollows that people evaluate the past self based on how it was different\nfrom the present self. This assumption is supported by the actor\u2013\nobserver effects found when people perceive their past selves as\n\u201cothers\u201d (Pronin & Ross, 2006) and that people expect the self to\nchange (i.e., become differentiated) over time (O\u2019Brien & Kardas,\n2016). Thus, a focus on differences combined with the properties of\nthe information ecology predicts that people perceive the past self as\nmore negative. Although people are motivated to perceive themselves\npositively and to improve, consequently disparaging the past self\npurposefully, this outcome is also predicted by comparisons in a\ntemporal information ecology with the properties outlined inTable 1.\nHowever, the diversity and frequency principles by themselves\nalso predict an unlikely outcome, namely, that distinct attributes of\nthe present self would also be negative (seeFigure 1). If people\nfocus on differences to evaluate the present self relative to the past,\nthe EvIE model predicts that people would evaluate their present self\nless positively. Because prior research showed that the present self is\nconsistently rated more positively than the past self (e.g.,Wilson &\nRoss, 2001), it seems unlikely that this prediction is correct. What\nkeeps present self-evaluations from turning negative, as the EvIE\nmodel would predict?\nThere are at least two possibilities within the EvIE model. First,\npeople may evaluate their present selves on what has remained the\nsame over time (i.e., similarities), making the present self positive.\nConversely, people may evaluate their past selves based on changes.\nThey may consider what differentiates the past self from the present,\nas the \ufb02ow of time backward might prompt difference testing\n(Mussweiler, 2003). This difference-based comparison would make\nthe past self negative.\nSecond, the growth principle may account for the positive view of\nthe present self. This second possibility works without assuming\ndifferent comparison directions. The growth principle is unique to\nthe temporal EvIE because the target and standard of comparison are\nnot independent in temporal comparisons. In a social comparison\nbetween Persons A and B, the attributes of each are drawn\nindependently from a world of possible attributes that each person\ncan possess; the attributes of Person B do not depend on what Person\nA already possesses and are not a function of any intraindividual\nprocesses that are shared between the two. However, this is not the\ncase when comparing the past and present self over time, as the\nattributes of the present self are a function of the past. Each attribute\nof the past self has a likelihood of remaining in the present self, and\neach attribute of the present self is largely in\ufb02uenced by those that\nalready exist in the person.\nAgain, the growth principle assumes that the present self has more\nlikely kept or gained positive attributes than negative attributes. If\nthe growth principle acts in concert with the diversity and frequency\nprinciples, it follows that differences will be negative unless offset\nby growth over time. A combination of the frequency, diversity, and\ngrowth principles would predict that distinct aspects of the present\nself should be a mix of positive and negative attributes. Depending\non how strongly each principle factors into the information ecology,\npresent self-differences could be expected to be more neutral or\npositive but unlikely to be negative.\nThe Supplemental Materialpresents a simulation that models four\ngrowth scenarios and how they impact evaluations of the past and the\npresent self as a function of comparing similarities and differences.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4654, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "652c542b-a504-443d-a57c-9271b972a04f": {"__data__": {"id_": "652c542b-a504-443d-a57c-9271b972a04f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "783", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc1b2d6c-e0f7-45d9-8b4a-74c608df4850", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "783", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "0537e7449f00a336a21640c384f053d40cf3a2104e7d09f2c0a0d9663b590ca7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "36058b5f-c2e9-4cd1-83e2-2e10460b6790", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "783", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "586137bf25bf509cc64c0fb10576cb8ad8bc987842bc2c29061e060e7c07c295", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Again, the growth principle assumes that the present self has more\nlikely kept or gained positive attributes than negative attributes.

Depending\non how strongly each principle factors into the information ecology,\npresent self-differences could be expected to be more neutral or\npositive but unlikely to be negative.\nThe Supplemental Materialpresents a simulation that models four\ngrowth scenarios and how they impact evaluations of the past and the\npresent self as a function of comparing similarities and differences. To\nsummarize the results, the simulation shows that without assuming\ngrowth, comparisons based on differences lead to negative evaluations\nof the present and past selves, while comparisons based on similarities\nlead to positive evaluation. However, if we assume growth, similarities\nremain the most positive, but the distinct past becomes more negative,\nand the distinct present becomes more positive. Thus, assuming\ngrowth, the cognitive\u2013ecological model\u2019s predictions coincide with a\nmotivational explanation for negative evaluations of the past self.\nThe current research tests the prediction of this cognitive\u2013ecological\nmodel of temporal self-comparisons. We present six experiments\n(Experiments 1\u20136) and an additional integrative analysis (Study 7) that\nmanipulate comparisons between past and present selves and ask\nparticipants to generate and evaluate attributes of their selves.\nWe use the following labels for all following experiments.\nComparisons entail a target and a standard (see Mussweiler,\n2003). The target is either the self in the past or the present, while\nthe comparison standard is the self in the present or past. The\ncomparison either focuses on the similarities or differences. For\nexample, we will use the labelpast differencesto describe a condition\nwhere participants evaluate distinct attributes of the past self relative to\nthe present self. Likewise, the labelpresent differencesdescribe a\ncondition in which participants evaluate distinct attributes of the\npresent self relative to the past self. In terms of similarities, we will use\npast similaritiesto describe a condition in which participants evaluate\nattributes of the past self that are also shared with the present self.\nFinally, we will usepresent similaritiesto describe a condition in\nwhich participants evaluate attributes of the present self that are also\nshared with the past self.\nOverview of Hypotheses and Experiments\nWe derived four hypotheses from the EvIE model\u2019s principles, as\nshown inTable 1. The exact predictions are based on the simulation\nin the Supplemental Material assuming growth.\nHypothesis 1:Participants will evaluate shared attributes between\nthe past and present selves most positively (i.e., similarities).\nHypothesis 2:Participants will evaluate distinct attributes of the\npast self least positively (i.e., past differences).\nHypothesis 3:Participants will evaluate distinct attributes of the\npresent self in between past differences and present similarities\n(i.e., present differences; due to growth, some distinct attributes\nwill be positive).\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nTEMPORAL SELF-APPRAISALS 783", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3796, "end_char_idx": 7470, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68023710-1ea7-4115-aed1-01103cfefc88": {"__data__": {"id_": "68023710-1ea7-4115-aed1-01103cfefc88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "784", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2dab41f0-3c3e-4000-b89e-df201766f640", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "784", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "747256cb59468479ac879f39b0f257696b03b0e946320d35feb9125f8e1e1843", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3fd615f8-ceef-4285-9219-df01fe26e29f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "74f14e43087d761c227d491d227993143ffa89ae7ed7c521773387fb726dc6c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Hypothesis 4: Baseline evaluations of the past and present\nselves will re\ufb02ect a combination of similarities and differences\nand fall between past differences and past/present similarities.\nWe will provide data for these hypotheses by randomly assigning\nparticipants to evaluate shared and distinct attributes associated with\ntheir past and present selves. We will also vary motivation to self-\nenhance to test how strongly motives may modulate the temporal\ncomparison process. Finally, we will test how changing the\ninformation ecology may modulate the temporal comparison process.\nWe present six experiments and one integrative data analysis in\nthree parts.

Part 2 tests predictions from a motivational account.\nExperiment 4 manipulates conditions that should promote (e.g., self-\nenhancement instructions) or inhibit (e.g., self-accuracy instructions)\nmotivation to enhance the present self. Experiment 5 asks participants\nfor self-appraisals for another person, which should exclude a self-\nenhancement motive. Part 3 then tests manipulations of the ecology.\nExperiment 6 investigates the case of an evaluative ecology without\ngrowth by asking participants to generate and evaluate physical\nattributes.

As older age implies a potential decline in many\nattributes rather than growth, this integrative data analysis provides a\nstrong test of the cognitive\u2013ecological approach.\nOpen Science and Transparency\nAll participants were from the United States and were recruited\nfrom the general population on Mturk or Proli\ufb01c. Our samples are\nthereby likely limited by their WEIRDness (Western, educated,\nindustrialized, rich, and democratic). Thus, our results should be\ninterpreted in this context.\nWe conducted nine experiments in this series. Here, we report six of\nthese experiments (i.e., Experiments 1\u20136). TheSupplemental Material\nreports two further experiments; we relegated these to theSupplemental\nMaterial because Experiment S1 only replicates Experiment 1, and\nExperiment S2\u2019s manipulation check failed. Otherwise, these two\nexperiments fully support the presented hypotheses. We do not report\none experiment that examined response latencies rather than evaluative\nratings of attributes.\nThe experiments were not preregistered except for Experiment 3\n(https://osf.io/mcdnr/). We describe the power considerations at the\noutset of each study.\nThe data and analysis code for the eight reported experiments (i.e.,\npresent article andSupplemental Material) are available athttps://osf\n.io/3a72e/. The raw data are available as CSV\ufb01les. The analysis code\nis available in an annotated R\ufb01le. The Open Science Framework\n(OSF) project lists the experiments with different numbers, as it\nincorporates the experiments and simulation from theSupplemental\nMaterial. Supplemental Table S2provides an overview of the order\nin the OSF project.\nPart 1: Similarities Are Positive, Differences Are Negative\nPart 1 aims to test the cognitive side of the cognitive\u2013ecological\napproach. Thus, we manipulated whether temporal self-appraisals\nare based on similarities or differences. Experiments 1\u20133 are thereby\ntesting Hypotheses 1\u20133 as described above.\nExperiment 1: Testing Similarities Versus Differences\nWe varied the target (i.e., past or present self) and the comparison\nmode (i.e., similarities vs. differences). Thus, we asked participants\nto evaluate their past or present selves, as in other temporal self-\nappraisal research ( Haddock, 2004 ; Wilson & Ross, 2001 ).\nCrucially, however, participants either focused on differences or\nsimilarities between the present and past.\nAccording to our reasoning (see also the simulation in the\nSupplemental Material), if people are sampling attributes from the\nEvIE that follows the frequency, diversity, and growth principles, we\nexpect similarities to be most positive (Hypothesis 1), past differences\nto be most negative (Hypothesis 2), and present differences to fall\nbetween present similarities and past differences (Hypothesis 3).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4317, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fd615f8-ceef-4285-9219-df01fe26e29f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fd615f8-ceef-4285-9219-df01fe26e29f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "784", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2dab41f0-3c3e-4000-b89e-df201766f640", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "784", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "747256cb59468479ac879f39b0f257696b03b0e946320d35feb9125f8e1e1843", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "68023710-1ea7-4115-aed1-01103cfefc88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "784", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "fb0a5ec2c23d99cf188c2f62626ededc877819aace51f3e9c4b6ef5358d7893b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Experiment 1: Testing Similarities Versus Differences\nWe varied the target (i.e., past or present self) and the comparison\nmode (i.e., similarities vs. differences).

We manipulated both\nindependent variables between participants.\nTarget Manipulation\nIn the past condition, we instructed participants to spend a few\nmoments thinking about\u201chow yourself from last year is related to\nyourself today.\u201d In the present condition, we instructed participants\nto spend a few moments thinking about\u201chow yourself today is\nrelated to yourself from last year.\u201d Participants were then asked to\ntype four words or phrases into separate text boxes that described the\ntarget self (i.e., the past or present self) in terms of similarities or\ndifferences.\nComparison Manipulation\nIn the similarities condition, we instructed participants to describe\nattributes or characteristics of the target self that are also like the\nstandard. In the differences condition, we instructed them to\ndescribe characteristics of the target self that are not like the\nstandard.

The\ufb01gure suggests that\nparticipants evaluated attributes positively except when describing how\nthe past self differed from the present self. Indeed, a one-samplet test\ncomparing average attribute ratings to the midpoint of the scale (4=\nneutral) showed that overall, participantsrated their attributes positively,\nM = 4.82, SD = 1.97, 95% CI [4.54, 5.10],t(193) = 5.80, p < .001.\nHowever, Figure 2suggests that these ratings were moderated by\ncondition. We analyzed these data using a hierarchical regression\nmodel with attribute ratings as the outcome, target and comparison\nincluded as predictors in Step 1, and the Target\u00d7 Comparison\ninteraction included in Step 2. In Step 1, both main effects were\nsigni\ufb01cant. The effect of target,F(1, 191)= 23.00, p < .001, \u03b72p =\n0.11, indicated that participants rated attributes of the present self\nmore positively (M = 5.43, SE = 0.18) than attributes of the past self\n(M = 4.20, SE = 0.18). The effect of comparison,F(1, 191)= 34.61,\np < .001, \u03b72p = 0.15, indicated that participants rated similarities more\npositively (M = 5.55, SE = 0.18) compared to differences (M = 4.08,\nSE = 0.18).\nThese main effects were quali\ufb01ed by a signi\ufb01cant interaction\nbetween target and comparison,F(1, 190)= 15.66, p < .001, \u03b72p =\n0.07. Pairwise comparisons with Tukey\u2019s corrections1 showed that\nattributes in the past differences condition were rated more\nnegatively compared to all other conditions (past similarities:\ncontrast = 2.44, p < .001, d = 1.02; present differences: contrast=\n0.93, p < .001, d = 1.14; present similarities: contrast= 2.70, p <\n.001, d = 0.39). When looking at ratings of present differences and\nsimilarities, present differences were rated less positively, but the\neffect was not statistically signi\ufb01cant (p = .38). No other simple\neffects were signi\ufb01cant (ps > .85).\nDiscussion\nExperiment 1 supports Hypotheses 1 and 2 and partially\nHypothesis 3 as outlined above. In addition, it replicates the typical\ntemporal self-appraisal effect. Participants evaluated attributes of\nthe past self more negatively than the present self\u2019s attributes. This\neffect aligns with a self-enhancement motive and a cognitive\u2013\necological account. However, self-enhancement was only apparent\nwhen participants considered how the past self differs from the\npresent self, as predicted by the present cognitive \u2013ecological\napproach (see Hypothesis 2). Because past research (Wilson &\nRoss, 2001) did not specify the comparative judgments that factor\ninto past and present self-evaluations, these \ufb01ndings extend the\nspeci\ufb01city of temporal self-appraisal theory (Albert, 1977).\nThe data also supported Hypothesis 1, as similarities were rated\nmost positively. Partially supporting Hypothesis 3, present differences\nwere more positive than past differences descriptively, but statistically,\npresent differences were indistinguishable from similarities.\nIn theSupplemental Material, we report an experiment (Experiment\nS1) that replicated these data with instructions to compare with the self\nfrom 10 years ago instead of 1 year ago.

Present differences are buffered from\nthis effect because people are actually improving over time, and with\na strong enough growth factor, present differences may be primarily\npositive. These two effects cancel out, making present differences\nequally positive as similarities, although descriptively less positive.\nFrom a self-enhancement motive perspective, people should be\nmotivated to exaggerate present differences in service of self-\nenhancement. They might do this by strategically selecting those few\npresent differences that serve this function. In other words, the effect\nfor comparison mode (i.e., similarity vs. differences) in the present self\ncondition may not be located in the rating extremity but in the number\nof attributes generated. Participants may rate the\ufb01rst four attributes\nequally positively, but with more sampling, discover negative\ndifferences that would factor into their evaluations. Experiment 2\naddresses this possibility with a within-subjects design that allows for\nrelative evaluations of similarities and differences and sampling more\nattributes.\nExperiment 2: Within-Participants Attribute\nListing Paradigm\nBased on the considerations above, Experiment 2 kept the overall\nstructure of varying the comparison target (i.e., past vs. present self)\nand the comparison (i.e., similarities vs. differences). However, we\nimplemented three changes. Social comparisons involve testing\nhypotheses about similarities and differences between targets and\nstandards (Mussweiler, 2003) ,a n dt h et w oa r eo f t e ni n t e r t w i n e d ;\nbringing to mind similarities can also make differences accessible\n(Medin et al., 1993). In Experiment 1 (and Experiment S1; see\nSupplemental Material), we manipulated comparison mode between\nparticipants; participants considered only differences or similarities.\nHowever, when evaluating the target self (e.g., the present), people are\nlikely making relative judgments about their shared and distinct\nattributes. If differences are more negative than similarities (Unkelbach\net al., 2019, 2020), then rating differences relative to similarities within\na single target might produce more differentiated ratings, potentially\nproviding full support for Hypothesis 3. To better re\ufb02ect this process,\nExperiment 2 manipulated comparison mode within participants and\nasked participants to list both similarities and differences.\nSecond, assuming that the effect for the present self might not be\nin the ratings but in the number of arguments, we asked participants\nto generate as many attributes as they wanted, up to a maximum of\n20. Thereby, we might differentiate better between a motivational\nand a cognitive\u2013ecological account. If participants are motivated to\nmaximize self-improvement, this new setup provides the opportu-\nnity to generate many more negative past differences and many\nmore positive present differences. However, if the principles of the\ninformation ecology are factoring into evaluations, then people\nshould naturally pick up on some negative present differences. By\nallowing participants to list many attributes, we create a greater\nopportunity for them to \ufb01nd these negative present differences,\nthereby differentiating the two accounts.\nThird, we measured subjective self-continuity to the past self to\ntest whether this variable would moderate self-appraisals. If past\nself-disparagement in this study is due to participants distancing\nfrom the past self in service of self-enhancement, we should\ufb01nd that\nmore negative evaluations of past differences are associated with\nlower self-continuity, as shown similarly in past research (Wilson &\nRoss, 2001).

We examine this\npossibility in more detail in Experiment 3.\nExperiment 3: Adding a Baseline Condition\nExperiment 3 was a preregistered experiment (https://osf.io/mcdnr/)\nto further test the hypothesis that past self-differences\u2019 negativity\ndrives the temporal self-appraisal effect found in prior research. To\nbetter understand how speci \ufb01c comparisons stack up against\n\u201cnatural\u201d appraisals of the self, we included a baseline condition\nin Experiment 3, in which we instructed participants to evaluate their\npast and present selves without reference to speci\ufb01c comparisons.\nThus, the study was a 3 (comparison: baseline vs. differences vs.\nsimilarities) \u00d7 2 (target: past vs. present) mixed design with repeated\nmeasures on the second factor. All participants evaluated their present\nand past selves but either focused on differences or similarities or\nreceived no explicit comparison instructions. Experiment 3 is thereby\na direct test of Hypothesis 4, as described above.\nThe new baseline condition more closely matches previous\ntemporal self-appraisal research (Wilson & Ross, 2001), assuming\nthat this condition mixes similarities and differences (see also\nsimulation in theSupplemental Material). This condition allows us\nto test competing hypotheses: If people disparage past selves in\nservice of self-enhancement, then past self-evaluations in the\nbaseline condition should match past self-evaluations in the\ndifferences condition. In other words, without speci\ufb01c instructions\nto compare the past and present selves, people should still base their\npast self-evaluations on negative differences in the service of self-\nenhancement. However, if, instead, self-evaluations are a mix of\ncomparisons based on both similarities and differences, then\nbaseline evaluations of the past self should look more like the\naverage of the past differences and similarities conditions. Based on\nExperiments 1 and 2, we expected that past differences would be\nmost negative, whereas all other comparative evaluations would be\nrelatively equal and positive. However, when averaged together,\nevaluations of the self across differences and similarities conditions\nwill match self-evaluations in the baseline condition.\nExperiment 3 also allowed participants to consider a past self at\nany temporal distance that they would do naturally. That is, we did\nnot set a temporal distance when participants were asked to evaluate\ntheir past selves. Instead, we measured subjective distance at the end\nof the study to test whether past selves felt more distant when the\nresulting evaluation would bene\ufb01t the present self (e.g., when\ndifferences are the focus;Wilson & Ross, 2001). If disparaging the\npast self is easier when that self feels distant (Wilson & Ross, 2001),\nthen subjective distance should predict more negative evaluations of\nthe past self. Alternatively, the more negative a past self-evaluation,\nthe more subjectively distant that self should feel. Participants in this\nstudy had the freedom to evaluate very close or very distant selves,\nand we were able to test whether their evaluations were associated\nwith subjective distance.\nIn addition, we asked participants in this study to describe six\nattributes of their past and present selves, compared to four in\nExperiment 1 and the average of four attributes provided in the\nopen-ended format in Experiment 2. More attribute ratings allow\nmore reliable estimates of self-evaluations, and allowing partici-\npants to generate more attributes also increases the opportunity for\nself-enhancement by increasing the possible ratio of positive to\nnegative attributes. However, if participants are sampling from an\ninformation ecology as speci\ufb01ed inTable 1, then the overall attribute\nratings should be similar to Experiments 1 and 2.\nFinally, we also asked participants to provide an overall\nevaluation of their past and present selves along with the individual\nattribute ratings. This additional measure allows testing whether the\neffect translates from measures of speci\ufb01c attributes to measures of\nglobal self-evaluations.\nMethod\nParticipants and Design\nFor a 2 \u00d7 3 mixed design ( r between measures = 0.30;\nnonsphericity correction= 1), G*Power suggested a sample size of\n342 to detect a small interaction effect (f = 0.10) at 80% power (\u03b1 =\n.05), so we recruited 400 participants to account for any exclusions.\nWe recruited participants (Mage = 29.01, SDage = 10.12) from Proli\ufb01c\nfor $0.80.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4477, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d70b86ca-5d4e-4243-b37c-3a763413a599": {"__data__": {"id_": "d70b86ca-5d4e-4243-b37c-3a763413a599", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "788", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "10e88533-990a-4fc7-a980-9432c4869017", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "788", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "20e8ead5e0b4a8dcdca6afbd11791f5535fb41ff4bb41041ca90c3923ceecf28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aec49ee2-6053-440d-a978-97ea3be31f68", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "788", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "1f504f070caa295efe9f6ca90cbd34e6d90883326e6a53dbb8a5a5adcf1a520a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Finally, we also asked participants to provide an overall\nevaluation of their past and present selves along with the individual\nattribute ratings.

In the present condition, they listed six attributes of the present\nself that are different from the past self, and in the past condition, they\nlisted six attributes of the past self that were different from the present\nself.

A single-item attention check appeared in this measure.\nAfter rating each attribute, participants also evaluated the target selves\n(i.e., past and present) relative to others on a single item (e.g.,\n\u201cThinking about who you are today, how do you see yourself overall,\nrelative to most your peers;\u201d\u201c Thinking about who you were in the\npast, how do you see yourself then overall, relative to most your peers\nduring that time;\u201d 1 = much more negatively than most,7 = much\nmore positively than most). After providing the attribute ratings and\nthe overall evaluation, participants indicated how far in the past they\nwere thinking when describing their past selves (1= very recent past,\n5 = very distant past), completed demographics, and read a debrie\ufb01ng\nstatement.\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\n788 BALDWIN, ALVES, AND UNKELBACH", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3816, "end_char_idx": 6961, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d967108e-e9da-44b2-a1a1-60bb24270fc7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d967108e-e9da-44b2-a1a1-60bb24270fc7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "789", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dad82ce1-1b30-4ba2-ba7f-dec64c34a7a7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "789", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "4467b7c966b71b8cfa613ccda3f18c727a5516cc20253076031f71729efadb6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Results\nWe excluded participants who failed the attention check or\nindicated that they did not want their data included in analyses.

We found that subjective distance correlated positively\nwith overall past evaluations,r = 0.15, t(351) = 2.78, p = .04.\nParticipants evaluated their distant past selves more positively than\nmore recent past selves, which is opposite to predictions based on\nelf-enhancement. However, given the correlation\u2019s low strength, we\nwill not interpret it further. No other correlations with subjective\ndistance were signi\ufb01cant.\nWe also explored condition main effects and interactions, treating\ndistance as both an outcome variable and a moderator variable. A\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing whether subjective\ndistance was different across the comparison conditions was not\nsigni\ufb01cant, F(2, 350) = 0.02, p = .99. Subjective distance was\nvirtually identical across conditions and re\ufb02ected a moderate degree\nof subjective distance (M = 3.36, SD = 0.93). This means that more\nnegative past self-evaluations in the differences condition is unlikely\ndue to participants distancing from their past selves. Including\nsubjective distance as a moderator variable in the Comparison\u00d7\nDistance interaction models showed no signi\ufb01cant effects either.\nDistance did not moderate the baseline versus differences compari-\nson, the baseline versus similarities comparison for past and present\nattribute ratings, or overall evaluations (ps > .21). Finally, all\nsigni\ufb01cant two-way interactions reported in the previous section that\nshowed a stronger past self-disparagement effect in the differences\ncondition compared to the similarities condition remained signi\ufb01cant\nwhen including distance as a covariate. Thus, we found no evidence\nthat subjective distance in\ufb02uenced the temporal self-appraisal effects\nfound here.\nDiscussion\nExperiment 3 replicates the\ufb01ndings from Experiments 1 and 2\nwith several additional key insights. First, the target effect in the\nbaseline condition replicates prior research that the past self is\nevaluated more negatively than the present self when no explicit\ncomparison is made salient (Wilson & Ross, 2001). This result is\nrelevant in terms of convergent validity. Participants evaluated their\npast selves more negatively.\nHowever, the present data align with the suggested cognitive\u2013\necological explanation for this self-disparagement, namely that the\neffect might be a function of the comparison mode, independent from\nmotivation to increase the self-worth of the present self. First, in the\nbaseline condition, self-evaluations were statistically indistinguish-\nable from the combination of similarity and difference judgments\nbetween the past and present selves. People in the baseline condition\nwere free to bolster their present selves by disparaging their past\nselves to the same degree as people in the differences condition, but\nthey did not do so. This suggests that temporal self-appraisals are\ndriven by evaluative comparison processes, at least to the same\ndegree, beyond motivational forces.\nIn addition, subjective distance had virtually no in\ufb02uence on\nevaluations of the past self. Past work showed that subjective\ndistance manipulations moderate the past self-disparagement effect\n(Wilson & Ross, 2001), with more distance leading to greater\ndisparagement of the past self. We did not manipulate distance but\nmeasured it. However, we found no effect in Experiment 3 of\ndistance, as well as the other studies prior. Participants were free to\nchoose a temporal self that could also be objectively distant; they\nhad the degree of freedom to disparage past selves in the service of\nself-enhancement. Nevertheless, feeling far from the past self did\nnot translate into more negative evaluations of the past self.\nTaken together, Experiments 1\u20133 provide data consistent with the\nmechanism that temporal self-appraisals follow from the interaction\nof social comparisons with the evaluative ecology. We consistently\n\ufb01nd the in\ufb02uence of comparison mode in interaction with the target.\nThe motive to self-enhance by disparaging the past might also be at\nwork. However, we argue that a more basic cognitive\u2013ecological\nexplanation also describes the temporal self-appraisal process.\nMotives may act on top of evaluative processes to override,\nattenuate, or exacerbate the default patterns, but we argue that the\nphenomenon itself is probably more basic.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4481, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d75b4b8-5f3d-4ee6-88a7-afd45310b8c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d75b4b8-5f3d-4ee6-88a7-afd45310b8c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "791", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d7c5e3c-fb24-4cbe-aa40-081dbf78521f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "791", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "80349e3186e5774646ed3206ca4fad2f6cf035226bfe67c3185c6cd753fa685c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a470f2db-8428-4d1e-ad1e-884a7370f4d0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "791", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "4fc93f36cd8c3680daaf460f2ef487c3de31fcc6c9772aa167d11e150443dfe3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Nevertheless, feeling far from the past self did\nnot translate into more negative evaluations of the past self.\nTaken together, Experiments 1\u20133 provide data consistent with the\nmechanism that temporal self-appraisals follow from the interaction\nof social comparisons with the evaluative ecology.

To further test this idea,\nthe next section manipulates motivation in various ways and tests\nwhether it moderates the basic pattern.\nPart 2: Investigating Motives as a Moderator\nIn Part 2, we aim to manipulate the motivation to self-enhance, testing\nif it moderates the temporal evaluative asymmetry found in Part 1.\nIf motivation to enhance the present self explains the past self-\ndisparagement effects, then these effects should be exacerbated by\nmotivation to self-enhance and attenuated when those motivations are\nnot as strong. Moreover, self-enhancement motives should produce\nstronger present self-praise when participants are focused on distinct\nattributes of the present self (i.e., differences) because exaggerating\npresent differences would be a viable self-enhancement strategy.\nThere are several ways to manipulate the motivation to self-\nenhance. In Part 1, we already presented some evidence (or lack\nthereof) based on temporal distance. However, temporal distance is\nan indirect way to manipulate the in\ufb02uence of motivation. This\napproach needs the additional assumption that it is easier to disparage\nthe past self if it is farther away, and for our case, that it should mainly\noccur for the differences conditions. If participants evaluate their\nselves based on similarities, disparaging the past would negatively\nin\ufb02uence the evaluation of the present self.\nIn Part 2, we\ufb01rst summarize the evidence for temporal distance.\nAs Part 1 already suggested, we\ufb01nd no effects of temporal distance\non evaluations of the self. We then move to two experiments in\nwhich we directly manipulated self-enhancement motivations.\nManipulating and Measuring Temporal Distance\nAs discussed above, if motivation to self-enhance is a viable\nexplanation for the temporal self-appraisal asymmetry, then greater\ndistance to the past self should cause more disparaging. However,\nfor the cognitive\u2013ecological approach, subjective distance should\nnot matter as the resulting asymmetry would arise from accurate\nperceptions of past and present attributes regardless of the distance\nbetween the past and present selves.\nIn Part 1, we measured self-continuity in Experiment 2 and\nsubjective distance in Experiment 3. Although motivation should\ndrive people to distance themselves from their past selves to see\nimprovement, especially when the past self is negative in the previous\ndifferences conditions, we found no evidence that this occurred.\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nTEMPORAL SELF-APPRAISALS 791", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3736, "end_char_idx": 7164, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f9de91f-822b-4343-8012-6f893e20dc44": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f9de91f-822b-4343-8012-6f893e20dc44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "792", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c2097e4f-d310-4461-81d1-1eb481bfc13a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "792", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "fe6bd7e4d0d8b79ab8aa0234702475cdf963531e73bcb1a25606f78bd7db6085", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33b32ad5-b377-461a-9ac1-044474a8891e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "79c53c9b9e8873d68a22b2c9bbb320cdded6ce04d912b6f851514f90adc4eb78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "However, the lack of evidence might be due to measurement\nproblems.\nWe also observed no difference when we compared temporal\ndistance across experiments. Experiment 1 instructed participants to\ncompare with the self from 1 year ago. Experiment S1 replicated\nExperiment 1 with the instruction to compare with the self from 10\nyears ago (see above,Figure 2and Supplemental Figure S2). Please\nnote that we relegated Experiment S1 to theSupplemental Material\nnot due to methodological problems but because it only replicates\nExperiment 1 without substantial new evidence. Nevertheless, it\nallows a comparison of temporal distance across experiments.\nIn Experiment 1, participants evaluated the past self relatively\nnegatively in the differences condition,M = 2.98, 95% CI [2.51, 3.44].\nExperiment S1, when evaluating a self from 10 years ago, yielded a\nsimilar result, M = 3.22, 95% CI [2.81, 3.68]. As the con\ufb01dence\nintervals suggest, these means do not differ statistically. An analogous\npattern is visible when we compare the similarities conditions: In\nExperiment 1, the past self was much more positive when considering\nsimilarities, M = 5.42, 95% CI [4.95, 5.88]. Again, Experiment S1,\nwhen evaluating a self from 10 years ago, yielded a similar result,M =\n5.36, 95% CI [4.99, 5.74]. As the con\ufb01dence intervals suggest, these\nmeans do not differ statistically. Similarly, both experiments showed\nno differences when participants evaluated their present self positively\ncompared to differences from the past from 1 year ago (Experiment 1),\nM = 5.15, 95% CI [4.61, 5.69], and 10 years ago,M = 5.49, 95% CI\n[5.03, 5.96]. Finally, the means also do not differ statistically when\nparticipants evaluated their present selves, comparing similarities from\nthe past from 1 year ago (Experiment 1),M = 5.68, 95% CI [5.23,\n6.13], and 10 years ago,M = 5.80, 95% CI [5.44, 6.16]. In short, across\nexperiments, temporal distance did not matter for the present\nparadigm.\nThe Supplemental Material also reports Experiment S2. In this\nexperiment, we manipulated the subjective distance to the past self\nwithin the same experiment while keeping the objective distance the\nsame. We found no effect of this manipulation on participants\u2019\nevaluations. However, different from Experiment S1, Experiment S2\nhas two drawbacks. First, it was not powered to detect a potential\nthree-way interaction of target self (present vs. past), comparison\n(similarities vs. differences), and distance (near vs. far). Second, the\nitems that should serve as a manipulation check failed to show a\ndifference between distance conditions. Thus, Experiment S2 does\nnot allow conclusions regarding the role of temporal distance on self-\nevaluations.\nThe following Experiment 4 addresses these shortcomings and\naims to directly manipulate motivation by asking participants to be\naccurate or to self-enhance.\nExperiment 4: Self-Enhancement Versus Self-Accuracy\nAs argued above, temporal distance is a rather indirect way to\nmanipulate the motivation to self-enhance. A potentially more direct\nway would be a focus on self-enhancement versus self-accuracy. If\npeople aim to report accurate evaluations of themselves, we should\nexpect to see a pattern of temporal self-appraisal of negative past\ndifferences, slightly less positive present differences, and mostly\npositive similarities. Again, this pattern follows if we assume the\nconstituents of the temporal evaluative ecology (seeTable 1).\nIf, however, people are instructed to present the best possible\nevaluation of themselves, we should see that past differences are most\nnegative and present differences are most positive, as this pattern\nwould highlight the greatest degree of improvement. At the very least,\npast differences should be more negative under instructions to self-\nenhance than instructions to be accurate, as the self-enhancement\nmotive should lead to greater past self-disparagement (Wilson & Ross,\n2001).

Although this sample size\nstill falls short of what would be required to detect a medium-sized\nthree-way interaction with 80% power, the more direct manipulation\nof the self-enhancement motive should lead to a stronger effect.\nAfter providing consent, participants were randomly assigned to the\nconditions of a 2 (motive: enhancement vs. accuracy)\u00d7 2 (target: past\nvs. present)\u00d7 2 (comparison: similarities vs. differences) between-\nparticipants experiment. In the enhancement condition, participants\nwere instructed to \u201cimagine that you are applying for a job and\nare being asked to create a pro\ufb01le of your personal attributes and\ncharacteristics.\u201d They were told that their personal pro\ufb01le would be the\n\ufb01rst thing the hiring committee would see, so they should try to create\nthe best personal pro\ufb01le they could. They were also told that each\nhiring committee member would see their pro\ufb01le. These instructions\nwere meant to encourage participants to engage in self-enhancement.\nIn the accuracy condition, participants were instructed to\u201cimagine\nthat you are doing a self-awareness exercise and are being asked to\ncreate a pro\ufb01le of your personal attributes and characteristics.\u201d They\nwere told that their personal pro\ufb01le would determine how the self-\nawareness exercise would look, so they should try to create the most\naccurate personal pro\ufb01le they could. They were also told that they\nwould be the only person who would see their pro\ufb01le. These\ninstructions were meant to increase the drive for accuracy and reduce\nthe drive for self-enhancement relative to the enhancement condition.\nAfter being assigned to the motive conditions, participants were\nassigned to the same target and comparison conditions as in the\nprevious experiments. Participants considered a past self from 1 year\nago and typed four attributes of the target self in four separate\ntext boxes.\nMeasures\nAfter describing the target self, participants saw the four attributes\nthey had typed previously and rated the valence of each one on a\n7-point scale (1= extremely negative,7 = extremely positive; \u03b1 = .93).\nAt the end, we also measured closeness to the past self with three items\n(e.g.,\u201cHow close do you feel to who you were 1 year ago?\u201d 1 = not at\nall close;5 = very close).

It may be that self-enhancement\nvia past self-derogation is such an ingrained process that it happens\nalmost inevitably, despite variation in temporal distance, subjective\ndistance, and activation of different motives. As long as the self is the\ntarget, the drive to derogate the past self may trump situational factors\nthat would otherwise in\ufb02uence appraisals.\nExperiment 5 presents our\ufb01nal attempt to show that the negative\nevaluation of the past self, at least in the present setup, might follow\nfrom motivational forces. To do so, we changed the comparison\ntarget from the self to an acquaintance.\nExperiment 5: Evaluating an Acquaintance\nPeople are less likely to derogate others\u2019 past selves (Wilson &\nRoss, 2001), presumably because the motivation to derogate the past\nself of another person should be low. There would be little advantage\nfor the self to see others as improving over time, and in fact, one\ncould imagine that misperceiving others as better than they are could\nserve as a disadvantage; the negative consequences of trusting in\nnonexistent positive attributes and abilities of others could be large.\nHowever, if temporal appraisals lead to accurate perceptions of\nstability and change in the self and others over time, and we assume\nthat the temporal ecologies\u2019 constituents (frequency, diversity, and\ngrowth) underlie those appraisals, then we should expect temporal\nappraisals of others to follow the same pattern as temporal appraisals\nof the self. That is, if others possess more positive than negative\nattributes and typically improve at the same rate as oneself, then the\nevaluative asymmetry found in Experiments 1\u20134 should be evident to\nthe same degree when evaluating others. Experiment 5 tests this\npattern by changing the target from the self to an acquaintance.\nMethod\nParticipants and Design\nParticipants were 199 adults (Mage = 33.50, SDage = 7.81) who\nparticipated on Amazon Mturk for $0.50. This sample size allowed us\nto detect a similarly sized interaction effect as obtained in the previous\nexperiments with 80% power (\u03b1 = .05). After providing consent,\nparticipants were randomly assigned to the same 2 (target: past vs.\npresent)\u00d7 2 (comparison: similarities vs. differences) between-subjects\nconditions as before. However, different from before, participants were\ntold that we were interested in howthey think about others and were\nasked to bring to mind an acquaintance they had known for at least\n1 year. Participants then wrote that person\u2019s name in a text box,\nindicated the duration of the relationship with that acquaintance in\nmonths, and generated four attributes consistent with their assigned\nconditions.\nMeasures\nAfter describing the acquaintance, participants saw the four\nattributes they had generated and rated the valence of each one on a\n7-point scale (1= extremely negative,7 = extremely positive; \u03b1 = .85).\nAfter completing the tasks and measures, participants read a debrie\ufb01ng\nstatement and exited the study.\nResults\nWe excluded 26 participants who did not follow instructions to\ndescribe an acquaintance that they had known for more than 1 year.\nThe \ufb01nal sample consisted of 173 adults (Mage = 33.84, SDage =\n9.71, 59% male).

Even when evaluating an acquaintance, the pattern of results\nresembles those from Experiments 1\u20134 when participants evaluated\nthemselves. This\ufb01nding would be surprising under a motivational\naccount of temporal appraisal effects. However, it aligns with the\npresent cognitive\u2013ecological approach, suggesting that self and\nother temporal comparison effects arise from a similar process in a\nconsistent temporal information ecology (see also the simulation in\nthe Supplemental Material).\nObviously, we cannot rule out motivation to self-enhance. For\nexample, one explanation of these\ufb01ndings is that participants were\nstill motivated to enhance the acquaintance in a way that would\nre\ufb02ect positively on themselves, something akin to basking in\nre\ufb02ected glory (Cialdini et al., 1976).\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\n794 BALDWIN, ALVES, AND UNKELBACH", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3269, "end_char_idx": 6733, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7be342ec-71f8-400d-bd95-93218d47ef1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7be342ec-71f8-400d-bd95-93218d47ef1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "795", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a2f93399-4212-4803-a8b6-17a0f23fe413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "795", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "fb6a8b3a7785af2f4d38f5eaac0fa68b948e6cf2e11e9468b6371dc37cb38e59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "However, based on the presented\ufb01ve experiments and the data in\nthe Supplemental Material, we believe that there is good evidence to\nassume that negative evaluations of the past follow from the\nstructure of the information ecology.

Past differences\nare more negative than similarities, but present differences are not.\nAlthough there was some evidence that present differences were\nevaluated more negatively than similarities, the effects were rather\nweak. However, these effects do not support a motivated self-\nperception, as people should evaluate present differences positively to\nenhance the self. Instead, we suspect these evaluations are accurate:\nThe present self has the bene \ufb01t of growth and improvement,\neffectively blocking the probabilistic necessity that present differences\nwould be negative under the frequency (Alves et al., 2017a)a n d\ndiversity principles (Koch et al., 2016).\nOne test that derives from the cognitive\u2013ecological approach is to\nchange the ecology, an approach we also employed in other\ninvestigations (e.g., Alves et al., 2018; Unkelbach et al., 2008).\nPlease note that we have manipulated the cognitive side by asking for\nsimilarities and differences so far. In Experiments 6 and Study 7,\nwe now manipulate the constituents of the applicable information\necology. Namely, we will ask participants to evaluate aspects of\nthemselves that are not likely to improve at all stages of life and may\neven begin to decline past middle age. In other words, we use\necologies where the growth principle (seeTable 1) does not apply.\nExperiment 6: Comparing Physical Attributes\nIn Experiment 6, we focus on physical attributes, as physical\nattributes are likely to be stable or decline as people become older.\nWhen people bring to mind physical attributes, we should not expect\nto see the same asymmetry found in previous studies if those\ufb01ndings\nare due to cognitive\u2013ecological perceptions. Under the cognitive\u2013\necological model, we should\ufb01nd a main effect, such that differences\nare evaluated more negatively than similarities.

The only signi\ufb01cant effect that emerged when participants\nevaluated physical traits was the main effect of comparison, such that\ndifferences were rated less positively than similarities. This experiment\nsupports the ecological approach; in an ecology that cannot show\ngrowth up from a certain age point, only the typical main effect of\ncomparison mode remains that differences are less positive than\nsimilarities (i.e., the \u201ccommon good\u201d phenomenon; Alves et al.,\n2017a). On the other hand, from a motivated self-perception account,\nthere is little reason to assume that participants are not motivated to\nenhance their physical attributes (e.g., to perceive themselves in good\nhealth and physical standing).\nThus, the more likely explanation is that people are reporting an\naccurate perception of the self over time. Because physical attributes\ntend to improve in early life but stabilize and even decline later in life,\npresent differences will also tend to be negative. Although physical\nattributes of the present self are more positive than negative overall, the\nstatistical necessity that differences are negative (seeFigure 1)i sn o t\nbuffered by continued growth through middle and later life. As\nphysical attributes should become relatively more negative in middle\nand later life, the growth component is no longer present (seeTable 1),\nand only the\u201ccommon good\u201d phenomenon remains. The previous\ninteraction of comparison mode and target is likely due to the\ncombination of positivity prevalence with factual growth.\nExperiment 6 thereby suggests a further test. As growth is most\nlikely negatively accelerated (i.e., older people should show less\ngrowth than younger people), the observed interaction in the\nprevious studies should vary as a function of participant age. Study 7\naddresses this implication by combining relevant data from the prior\nexperiments and examining temporal self-appraisal effects across\nthe lifespan.\nStudy 7: Temporal Self-Appraisal Across the Lifespan\nOur proposed growth principle is supported by systematic reviews\nof the developmental trajectory ofself-evaluations over time. For\ninstance, self-esteem generally improves through adolescence and\nearly adulthood but rapidly declines in older age ( Robins &\nTrzesniewski, 2005). Others have suggested that this rise and fall of\nfavorable self-evaluation coincideswith a stark increase in physical and\ncognitive abilities through early and middle adulthood, as well as new\nopportunities related to career,\ufb01nancial, relational security, status, and\nso on (Demo, 1992). However, these improvements and opportunities\nalso decline in late adulthood and old age, as do favorable self-\nevaluations. In sum, through processes of reinforcement, learning, and\ntrue developmental change, people are likely to improve over time for\nmuch of their lives, with decline being common in older age.\nThus, as the growth principle becomes weaker or even reverses for\nolder adults, the cognitive\u2013ecological approach predicts that negative\nevaluations of past self-differences should become weaker and negative\nevaluations of present self-differences should become stronger (i.e., due\nto a negatively accelerated growth curve). In these predicted directions,\nevidence for moderation by age would provide evidence that temporal\nself-appraisals reveal mostly accurate perceptions of self-attributes\nover time.\nSuch a result is also not predicted by a motivational account. A\nmotivational account would still predict that older adults practice\npast self-disparagement. Otherwise, one would need to assume that\nolder adults have less motivation to self-enhance, despite perceiving\nlittle improvement, and even decline, from their past selves (Fleeson\n& Heckhausen, 1997; Ryff, 1991).\nAlternatively, older adults would need to choose present\nattributes that still improve with age and thereby positively impact\nself-worth, for instance, wisdom or compassion, and derogate the\npast self on these dimensions to perceive improvement (seeWilson\n& Ross, 2001).

However, as we have argued and now shown,\neffects of temporal self-appraisal may follow directly from basic\ncognitive and ecological aspects of comparative judgment. Because\npeople evaluate targets based on their distinct features relative to\nsome standard and because distinct features of those targets are\nstatistically likely to be negative in the typical evaluative ecology, the\nresulting evaluation is also likely to be negative (Alves et al., 2017a,\n2018). We show that the same principles apply beyond comparisons\nof targets to comparisons of the self over time.\nThe present research departed from prior research in one important\nway. We explicitly asked participants to generate relative judgments\nof past and present selves, whereas, in past research, participants did\nnot, although they could have been making relative judgments\nnevertheless (Wilson & Ross, 2001). This is important because our\nmethod allows us to examine how people perceive their distinct\npresent self-attributes. A person guided by a motive to self-enhance\nwould not want to perceive the present self as less positive, but we\n\ufb01nd some evidence that this is the case when reality constrains the\nkinds of information being evaluated (Experiments 6 and Study 7).\nSimilarly, when evaluating an acquaintance or when prompted to\nmake accurate (vs. enhanced) self-evaluations, present self-differences\nwere more positive than past self-differences. Moreover, other\nmotivational variables did not seem to moderate this effect.\nTogether, our \ufb01ndings match what would be expected from basic\ncomparison processes occurring in an information ecology where\npositive attributes are more frequent and negative attributes are more\ndiverse (Unkelbach et al., 2019, 2020). When positive attributes are\nmore frequent and more similar, the self will be more negative (or less\npositive) on average when evaluated based on its differences (see\nFigure 1). This outcome is less pronounced for the present self because\nof a third property of the temporal information ecology: Positive\ninformation is reinforced over time,leading to actual growth. This third\nprinciple balances negative present differences with positive ones.\nChanging the Ecology Versus Changing Motivation\nThe presented data align with the cognitive\u2013ecological approach\nfor two reasons. First, we consistently found that the cognitive\nprocess (i.e., comparisons based on similarities or differences) has\nthe predicted outcome, replicating a\u201ccommon good\u201d phenomenon\nover time (seeAlves et al., 2017a). Second, when we changed the\nassumed properties of the ecology (Experiment 6 and Study 7), we\nobserved the predicted changes in the outcomes of temporal self-\nappraisal. When participants evaluated physical attributes, which\nshould show no growth when people get older, the typical asymmetry\nin temporal self-appraisal was replaced with a main effect, such that\ndifferences of both the past and present selves were evaluated less\npositively. Similarly, older adults evaluated past and present\nattributes less positively when we combined all samples. Indeed,\nthere was a trend for older adults to evaluate past differences more\npositively than present differences\u2014 a reversal of the asymmetry\nfound for younger adults.\nThis \ufb01nding aligns with prior research. In tests of the EvIE,\nreversing the information ecology (e.g., to make negative information\nmore frequent than positive information) was also shown to produce\nconsistent changes to the consequences of social comparison. For\ninstance, although focusing on differences in an ecology where\npositive information was frequent, participants evaluated new\nindividuals from an outgroup negatively, as the new individuals are\nevaluated based on their differences. However, those same individuals\nwere evaluated positively when the negative information was frequent\nin the information ecology (Alves et al., 2018).\nThese \ufb01ndings do not disprove the in\ufb02uence of self-enhancement\nmotives. For example, one explanation might be that motivation to\nself-enhance is reduced when evaluating physical characteristics or\nwhen one is getting older. However, physical health is considered\none of many \u201culterior\u201d interests that are\u201crelevant to virtually all\nexperiences that bear on the well-being of the self\u201d (Alicke &\nSedikides, 2009; p. 7).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4550, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9768873a-8b18-418c-8e4e-fd707cc25695": {"__data__": {"id_": "9768873a-8b18-418c-8e4e-fd707cc25695", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "799", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef80e201-cc2b-48b1-bad0-3ce3fe025f01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "799", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "3054190c3863e2678fd48cfb82719d65ef254a231d10e6b0011f90bcee816e7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "314d75e3-1ac0-4c0c-a717-d45a4b09b4e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "799", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "41594eb090abfe82948aad0cd0959c304f919be5dbbdb1bb5f438338b4f9a2f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For\ninstance, although focusing on differences in an ecology where\npositive information was frequent, participants evaluated new\nindividuals from an outgroup negatively, as the new individuals are\nevaluated based on their differences.

Moreover, research has shown that the self-\nenhancement motive does indeed apply to physical traits and\nattractiveness (Alicke & Sedikides, 2009; Bleske-Rechek et al.,\n2008; Epley & Whitchurch, 2008; Gabriel et al., 1994). It is\nreasonable to predict that participants would be motivated to enhance\ntheir physical attributes when given the chance to select and evaluate\nphysical characteristics that they have gained over time (i.e., present\ndifferences). We found no evidence for such motivated comparison\nprocesses.\nThus, we believe the more plausible explanation for the\ufb01ndings\nof Experiment 6 and Study 7 is that the properties of the temporal\ninformation ecology are different for physical attributes and older\nadults. It is a biological inevitability that our physical attributes\ndecline throughout the lifespan and begin as early as our 20s and 30s\n(Hall et al., 2017; Thompson et al., 2014). Thus, as people get older,\nimprovement begins to slow down, and perhaps the ecology\nreverses completely under some circumstances (e.g., in extreme old\nage or when one contracts a terminal illness). Without the growth\nprinciple acting to reinforce and add positive attributes (and remove\nnegative attributes) to the ecology, the evaluative asymmetry found\nin Experiments 1\u20135 disappears.\nTo summarize our claims based on these data, we propose that the\nevaluative ecology is both a constraint and an affordance. When\nreality constrains self-enhancement, evaluations are more negative.\nWhen reality affords self-enhancement, evaluations are more\npositive. We have outlined a model in which a single cognitive\nprocess (comparison) interacts with features of the world (positivity\nprevalence, negativity diversity, growth) that can explain the full\nrange of evaluations that result from temporal self-appraisals. Thus,\nreality (i.e., the ecology) may have a stronger in\ufb02uence on temporal\nself-appraisals than previously thought.\nImplications for Self-Continuity\nSelf-continuity, or the feeling that one\u2019s present self is connected\nwith past and future selves, is often viewed as a precursor to\npsychological health and well-being, shown to be associated with\nsuccessful long-term relationships and a supporter of life satisfac-\ntion, to name just a few (Sani, 2010). For this reason, people need to\nmaintain self-continuity (Bluck & Alea, 2008), which implies that\nself-continuity is something that people can construct themselves, a\nself-perception that people need for positive psychological\nfunctioning. Our current model suggests, however, that the link\nbetween self-continuity and positive psychological outcomes could\nbe a natural result of evaluations of the self over time in an\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nTEMPORAL SELF-APPRAISALS 799", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3748, "end_char_idx": 7480, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1eb8b65e-4e09-4ee0-90c8-0e7c86adc239": {"__data__": {"id_": "1eb8b65e-4e09-4ee0-90c8-0e7c86adc239", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "800", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "006a33f4-7363-4694-95e1-7ebea19f1222", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "800", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "c0824d479bb2255ba4b2dafe16212fe5796edbcda5c2ab52a50f80e57ab46d72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e04a202-ced6-4627-97f9-00d6dbf5882f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2aed598511e141f01776cc534ce7e75abf97121b88ed79c1b2a1d7203c20ff1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "information ecology with the properties speci\ufb01ed above (seeTable 1).\nWhen asked to consider if oneself is continuous and stable over time,\nsome people may test the hypothesis\u201cHow have I stayed the same?\u201d\nand look for similarities in the self over time. This evaluation is likely\nto bring to mind positive self-attributes.\nPeople may also focus on the attributes \ufb01rst rather than the\ncomparison. Making a judgment about self-continuity could start\nwith selecting an important or de\ufb01ning attribute and testing whether\nthat attribute has remained a de\ufb01ning characteristic over time. If most\npeople are positive most of the time, selecting positive traits to test\nthis hypothesis will likely result in a heightened sense of continuity.\nThinking about self-continuity as an interaction between temporal\nself-comparison and the temporal EvIE might lead to novel\nhypotheses. For instance, it should be the case that self-continuity\nis associated with less positive outcomes in an evaluative ecology\nthat favors negative information. Indeed, if things have always been\nbad, looking for similarities should bring to mind mostly negative\ninformation, making self-continuity a negative experience. Future\nresearch may incorporate aspects of the temporal EvIE into the study\nof self-continuity to gain more insight into its source and relation to\npsychological well-being. For instance, younger adults report lower\nself-continuity and self-concept clarity than older adults but are more\nlikely to use their autobiographies to develop a sense of continuity\n(Bluck & Alea, 2008). How does chronic focus on similarities and\ndifferences shape these trends, and How would these comparisons\ninteract with changes to the EvIE? Very little is known about these\nbasic cognitive\u2013ecological foundations of self-continuity.\nThe Growth Principle\nThe growth principle sets a temporal information ecology apart\nfrom a standard ecology: Positive attributes are reinforced over time.\nConsider the attributes of a person as if they are arranged in a\nnetwork, with some attributes being highly connected (i.e., similar)\nand others being highly disconnected (i.e., dissimilar; seeDalege et\nal., 2017, 2018, 2019). In such a network, similar and connected\nattributes would reinforce one another, whereas dissimilar and\ndisconnected attributes would not. For instance, being considerate\nmight also reinforce being caring because the respective behaviors\nare similar and tend to co-occur. In contrast, two dissimilar\nattributes, such as careless and fearful, would not reinforce each\nother to the same degree, as the two tend not to co-occur. When\nconsidered in a network, the similarity between attributes is directly\nrelated to how\u201cactivated\u201d those attributes are. This will apply not\nonly to how those attributes manifest in behavior (e.g., acting\nconsiderate also makes one caring) but also to how salient they are in\ncognition (e.g., thinking about how one is considerate also brings to\nmind how one is caring). Over time, this positive attribute network\ngrows in strength and size because activating positive attributes that\none possesses now (either through behavior or in cognition) is likely\nto activate closely related positive attributes that one does not yet\npossess. Although this idea is speculative and theoretical, similar\nprinciples have been shown to operate at the level of attitudes\n(Dalege et al., 2017, 2018, 2019).\nThese ideas are currently limited by a lack of empirical evidence.\nWe strongly believe that positive attributes are reinforced over time,\nas discussed in the introduction. However, we do not know whether\nthis follows from the diversity principle or, for example, forces\noutside the individual or even forces (e.g., motivation) inside the\nindividual. Future research may test whether positive attributes\nstrengthen and grow over time because these attributes are more\nsimilar to one another. Additionally, it should be con\ufb01rmed that new\npositive attributes that individuals gain are highly contingent on one\nor more existing positive attributes. New statistical methods and\ntools would allow us to test these predictions using attribute network\nmodels. In future research, measures of network strength for both\npositive and negative attributes could be used to predict variability\nin temporal self-appraisal effects.\nThe growth principle also predicts that, for much of one\u2019s life, the\ndiversity of positive attributes should shrink over time.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4445, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e04a202-ced6-4627-97f9-00d6dbf5882f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e04a202-ced6-4627-97f9-00d6dbf5882f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "800", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "006a33f4-7363-4694-95e1-7ebea19f1222", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "800", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "c0824d479bb2255ba4b2dafe16212fe5796edbcda5c2ab52a50f80e57ab46d72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1eb8b65e-4e09-4ee0-90c8-0e7c86adc239", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "800", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "916c9c5a796d86e690c0ea70b8e78ffc5bcf4d3a051eef348bc283319ed59960", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We strongly believe that positive attributes are reinforced over time,\nas discussed in the introduction.

This principle\ncould explain why self-concept clarity, or the feeling that one\u2019s self-\nconcept is clearly and con\ufb01dently de\ufb01ned, is so strongly associated\nwith positive self-regard (Campbell et al., 1996) and increases with\nage (Bluck & Alea, 2008). Over time, positive attributes tend to\ngroup tightly into a strongly connected attribute cluster. These\nattributes would be more accessible in the self-concept and, because\nthey reinforce one another, would be judged more con\ufb01dently and\nclearly as part of one\u2019s self. More research is needed to understand\nbetter what these attribute networks look like across the lifespan and\nhow they relate to temporal self-appraisal and other aspects of the\nself, such as clarity and continuity.\nFinally, the growth principle must have boundaries; people will not\nimprove over time ad in\ufb01nitum. As Study 7 suggested, many attributes\nwill stabilize or even decline again over time. This is self-evident for\nphysical attributes but might also be true for psychological attributes.\nThus, a negatively accelerated or even an inverse U-shape function\nseems a potential candidate to model growth as the third structural\nproperty, beyond frequency and diversity, in a temporal ecology.\nLimitations\nWe need to acknowledge several limitations of the presented\nresearch. First, we proposed a cognitive \u2013ecological model for\ntemporal self-appraisal. In this model, motivation is not necessary\nto explain the results\u2014 both present the previous (e.g.,Wilson & Ross,\n2001). However, we did not create experimental conditions in which a\nmotivational explanation and a cognitive\u2013ecological explanation make\nopposing predictions. Rather, we only have experiments in which one\nexplanation predicts a certain outcome, while the other is largely silent\nabout the outcome. Thus, the absence of evidence does not disprove a\nmotivational explanation, and a complex process such as temporal\nself-assessment most likely incorporates several cognitive, ecological,\nand motivational processes and their interactions.\nSecond, as stated above, our results are restricted by our samples.\nWe relied exclusively on online participants from the United States.\nAt the moment, it is an open question whether the results will\ngeneralize to other settings and other cultures.\nFinally, we used the label\u201ctemporal appraisals.\u201d However, we\nonly investigated appraisals of the present and the past. Extending\nthe present cognitive\u2013ecological model to comparison with future\nselves at various levels of age seems a promising venue. However, at\nthe moment, the data are limited to comparison with past selves.\nConclusion\nWe set out to explain the self-enhancement function of temporal\ncomparison based on basic cognitive principles (i.e., comparisons\nbased on similarities and differences) and known properties of the\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\n800 BALDWIN, ALVES, AND UNKELBACH", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3470, "end_char_idx": 7510, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75eb7abf-53b6-4cbc-918e-846a7c224132": {"__data__": {"id_": "75eb7abf-53b6-4cbc-918e-846a7c224132", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "801", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f9b96883-0c19-439c-99e3-bf6fee5645e2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "801", "file_name": "demo_2.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_2.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2539245, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "ff69be6e4c8a25181ec738d95fad29c5f322a1e05bbcfcb0255723f7600a4645", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad27c305-b163-426a-928f-c5f2a4b69ad5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "31c53c61fa6f47f5631e71d10f970f9bcdc939df48b10668dace95bfa97442c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "information ecology (i.e., positivity prevalence, negativity diversity,\nand growth).

Ten preregistered experiments (N = 5,542) reveal\nwhen, why, and how peopleviolate their social judgment thresholds, even after formally establishing them\nbased on having full information about what might unfold. People can be swayed to be both\u201cquicker to judge\u201d\n(e.g., promising reward/punishment after 3 good/bad behaviors, yet then acting after 2 such behaviors) and\n\u201cslower to judge\u201d (e.g., promising reward/punishment after 3 good/bad behaviors, yet then withholding until\n4 such behaviors)\u2014 despite all behaviors obeying their threshold. We document these discrepancies across\nmany parameters. We also propose and test an integrative theoretical framework to explain them, rooted in\npsychological support: Being both\u201cquicker\u201d and \u201cslower\u201d to judge re\ufb02ect a shared function of the distinct\nmodes of evaluation involved in the act of setting social judgment thresholds (involving a packed summary\njudgment extending across myriad possible realities) versus following them in real time (involving an\nunpacked focus on whatever speci\ufb01c reality unfolds, which could provide higher or lower support than\nthreshold setters had accounted for). Manipulating the degree of psychological support thus determines the\ndirection of threshold violations: Higher support produces\u201cquicker to judge\u201d effects while lower support\nproduces \u201cslower to judge\u201d effects. Finally, although violating one\u2019s preset threshold may sometimes be to\none\u2019sb e n e\ufb01t, we document initial evidence that it also risks damaging people\u2019s reputations and relationships.\nWhen it comes to treating others, making exceptions to the rule may often be the rule\u2014 for better or worse.\nKeywords: change perception, thresholds, social judgment, reputation, reward/punishment\nSupplemental materials: https://doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000339.supp\nBeing deemed a sinner or a saint requires some history of bad or\ngood deeds. To take a rather literal example, the Catholic Church\ndemands evidence of two miracles after a person\u2019sd e a t ht ob e\ncanonized for sainthood. When Mother Teresa was posthumously\nconsidered for sainthood, however, her supporters grew impatient\nwith the rigidity of this threshold (Perry & Hume, 2016). In prospect,\naccomplishing two miracles seemed uncontroversial; in practice, it\nseemed increasingly draconian as Mother Teresa\u2019sl e g a c yg r e w .\nThis example highlights the fact that \u2014 far beyond matters\nspiritual\u2014 people often predetermine thresholds for when to\npass social judgment. Indeed, people constantly hold others to\ncertain expectations for good and bad behavior (Kahneman et al.,\n1986), and such expectations often are quanti \ufb01ed in advance.\nTeachers might set a \ufb01xed number of reprimands that may go\non a student\u2019s record before expelling them; managers might set a\nsales target that an employee must hit before bonusing them;\nparents might set ground rules that a child must abide by before\nrewarding or punishing them; and so on.\nHow do people\u2019s preset thresholds for passing social judgment\ncompare with those they adhere to in practice? Rules such as thresh-\nolds necessitate that they apply. Our opening example, however, hints\nat a discrepancy: People might act more patiently in prospect (e.g.,\nsetting \u201c2 miracles for sainthood\u201d) than in practice (e.g., calling for\nsainthood after \u201cjust 1 miracle\u201d).

As we will put\nforth, there is a fundamental psychological difference between\nhow people set thresholds in prospect versus how people follow\nthresholds in practice, re\ufb02ecting a distinction between \u201cpacked\u201d\njudgment (i.e., having to consider myriad possible outcomes in\nthe aggregate) versus \u201cunpacked\u201d judgment (i.e., reacting to the\nspeci\ufb01c outcome that ends up unfolding). Preset thresholds may\ntherefore be rendered too high (\u201cquicker\u201d to judge, replicating\nKlein & O\u2019Brien\u2019s, 2018 effect) or too low (\u201cslower\u201d to judge),\nboth as a function of how people come to view the particular reality\nthat subsequently manifests.\nSetting Versus Following Social Judgment Thresholds\nPeople pass judgment when they believe suf\ufb01cient evidence is\navailable (Klein & O\u2019Brien, 2016; O\u2019Brien, 2020, 2022; O\u2019Brien &\nKlein, 2017). We propose, however, that these two modes of\njudgment\u2014 presetting thresholds versus following them in real\ntime\u2014 differentially shift when people hit this point. We draw on\nsupport theory for inspiration.\nSupport theory (Tversky & Koehler, 1994) explains judgments\nunder uncertainty. It applies mainly to probability judgments. How-\never, its main propositions also apply to setting versus following\nsocial judgment thresholds.\nFirst, support theory posits that people judge the probability of\nevents based on how they are described. In turn, event descriptions\nvary in the degree to which they make it easy or dif\ufb01cult to imagine\nthe events happening, which support theory de\ufb01nes as the psycho-\nlogical \u201csupport\u201d people can summon for those events. This can be\nrepresented as:\nP\u00f0A, B\u00de = s\u00f0A\u00de\ns\u00f0A\u00de + s\u00f0B\u00de : (1)\nHere in Equation 1,( A) and (B) are mutually exclusive events,\nP(A, B) is the judged probability of those events, ands(A) ands(B)\nare how the events are described. For example, suppose people are\nasked to estimate the chance that they will\u201cdie from any natural\ncause\u201d (A) rather than from something else ( B); according to\nEquation 1, these estimates are a function of the relative strength\nof support (s) people can summon for (A) over (B).\nSecond, support theory posits that psychological support depends\non whether information is presented aspacked or unpacked. This\ncan be represented as:\ns\u00f0A\u00de \u2264 s\u00f0A1 \u2228 ::: \u2228 An\u00de: (2)\nHere inEquation 2, \u201cpacked\u201d categories elicit less (or no more)\nsupport than their \u201cunpacked\u201d components when disjunctively\npresented. For example, consider the comparison between\u201cdying\nfrom any natural cause\u201d versus \u201cdying from heart disease, cancer,\nor any other natural cause. \u201d This information is statistically\nequivalent\u2014 yet numerous tests of support theory\ufb01nd that people\njudge its latter \u201cunpacked\u201d description as more probable (e.g.,\nFischhoff et al., 1978; Johnson et al., 1993; Mulford & Dawes,\n1999; Redelmeier et al., 1995; Rottenstreich & Tversky, 1997;\nRusso & Kolzow, 1994; Van Boven & Epley, 2003).\nSupport theory suggests this effect of piecemeal unpacking\n\u201crepresents a basic principle of human judgment,\u201d as it\u201cenhances\n[the component\u2019s] salience and hence its support\u201d (Tversky &\nKoehler, 1994, p. 549). Many categories contain too many layers\nfor people to consider (e.g., it is impossible to bring to mind every\ncause of death), leading people to change their estimates based on\nwhat is unpacked (\u201cOh, right; heart disease and cancer are big ones.\nNatural causes are a big problem\u201d).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3796, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "664a8cf9-cea7-4bde-b291-522b47a5c964": {"__data__": {"id_": "664a8cf9-cea7-4bde-b291-522b47a5c964", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "285", "file_name": "demo_3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1558991, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2517343b-36e8-48ab-aaa8-4832e8015fd9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "285", "file_name": "demo_3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1558991, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "b5519a60d9a1fd5ec78218bde0ac0e1aa1b62da4a4e7213be3302213874a82d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7afb009-63f8-4309-8c55-1f10bef9b77b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "285", "file_name": "demo_3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1558991, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "bb51fff5700072e4f7c96e0abc51aaf70d6ee7d8471aa3d1f4cfdb98acf83956", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Support theory suggests this effect of piecemeal unpacking\n\u201crepresents a basic principle of human judgment,\u201d as it\u201cenhances\n[the component\u2019s] salience and hence its support\u201d (Tversky &\nKoehler, 1994, p. 549). Many categories contain too many layers\nfor people to consider (e.g., it is impossible to bring to mind every\ncause of death), leading people to change their estimates based on\nwhat is unpacked (\u201cOh, right; heart disease and cancer are big ones.\nNatural causes are a big problem\u201d). By this same rationale, however,\nthe effect isreversed when unpacking draws attention to compo-\nnents withweak support (Macchi et al., 1999; Sloman et al., 2004).\nFor example, people may believe they are more likely to die from\n\u201cheart disease, cancer, or any other natural cause\u201d than from\u201cany\nnatural cause\u201d\u2014 but they mayalso believe they areless likely to die\nfrom \u201csepticemia, malaria, or any other natural cause\u201d than from\n\u201cany natural cause\u201d (\u201cOh, right; there are lots of things that won\u2019t\naffect me. Natural causes aren\u2019t always a big problem\u201d).\nPut in terms of our research, the act of setting thresholds in advance\nresembles support theory\u2019s \u201cpacked\u201d judgments. For example, a\nmanager might set a reward threshold of\u201c5 stars get a bonus\u201d or a\nreprimand threshold of\u201c3 strikes get a penalty.\u201d Yet in presetting such\nthresholds, note how dif\ufb01cult it is for managers to have summoned\neach particular version or combination of how\u201c5s t a r s\u201d or \u201c3s t r i k e s\u201d\ncan play out (across employees, contexts, time, and so on); such a task\nis effectively impossible, akin to having to bring to mind every\npossible cause of death to inform one\u2019s global estimate. People are\nfound to make prediction errors even when tasked with imagining a\nsingle reality, faithfully described (Wilson & Gilbert, 2005)\u2014 let alone\nwhen tasked with imagining the myriad of realities that can unfold to\nbegin with. All else equal, people\u2019s preset thresholds are therefore\nlikely summoned based on some salient representative average or\nsummary (\u201cWhat is a star or strike here typically like?\u2026 How many\nof those may make a fair threshold for all?\u201d), just as how support\ntheory assumes people generate\u201cpacked\u201d probabilities (e.g.,\u201cWhat\nare some typical causes of death?\u2026 How likely are they?\u201d)\u2014 which\npresetters may take as the next best proxy for determining a fair\nthreshold (Anderson, 1965; Asch, 1946; Birnbaum, 1972).\nConversely, the act of following thresholds as they actually\nunfold resembles support theory\u2019s \u201cunpacked\u201d judgments; indeed,\nreality always plays out as an unpacked state. Yet note that the\nunpacked pieces that reality unveils need not correspond to some\nrepresentative summary experience; myriad speci\ufb01c versions or\ncombinations of events could end up unfolding, ranging from\ncompleted tasks that wield higher support (akin to\u201cheart disease\nand cancer\u201d) to those that wield lower support (akin to\u201csepticemia\nand malaria\u201d). Consistent with the logic of support theory, these\ndifferences in support should change how people respond in real\ntime, in ways presetters might not have accounted for.\nOur Proposed Model\nPutting these ideas together, we propose that the points at which\npeople pass social judgment will depend on the support they can\nsummon for what unfolds\u2014 which will vary by their mode of\njudgment (see Figure 1).\nSetting thresholds in advance is a form of prediction whereby\njudges must make a decision about multiple individual behaviors\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nTHRESHOLD VIOLATIONS IN SOCIAL JUDGMENT 285", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3306, "end_char_idx": 7011, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0dbbfc2f-a034-4c1c-b517-2764d4a305ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "0dbbfc2f-a034-4c1c-b517-2764d4a305ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "286", "file_name": "demo_3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1558991, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e051789-d5a9-4d8c-bdc6-64c35f9ed95d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "286", "file_name": "demo_3.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_3.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1558991, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "0c07bf98d159536e64f2d12580dbc62ecfd0a5bfa9923a29b0269c5cf322b4fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "packed together, leading them to generate some global estimate that\nmay fairly apply as a threshold. In contrast, following thresholds is a\nform of experience whereby judges encounter each piecemeal\nbehavior as it unfolds, with each piece wielding its own support\u2014\nin speci\ufb01c individual ways that presetters might not have fully\naccounted for (even when knowing that all such pieces were\npossible). Higher support should therefore lower thresholds and\nhasten judgment (vs. what was envisioned); lower support should\nraise thresholds and slow judgment. This model allows one to\npredict not only when people are\u201cquicker\u201d to judge relative to\npreset thresholds (as put forth byKlein & O\u2019Brien, 2018) but also\nwhen people are\u201cslower\u201d to judge\u2014 both depending on the support\nprovided by what unfolds.\nIn addition, given this model, one can ask: What are the psycho-\nlogical inputs into support (bold box inFigure 1)? The current\nresearch will test some (nonexhaustive) possibilities (e.g., as we will\ndiscuss, unpacked behaviors that elicit higher vs. lower emotions\ntend to elicit higher vs. lower support); we will expand on each as\nthey arise in our experiments. Our broader point here is not about\nany one such factor per se; rather, we propose that they are examples\nof the same broader construct\u2014 support\u2014 that is the key driver\nexplaining when and why people may violate social judgment\nthresholds, ineither direction.\nOverview of Experiments\nTen preregistered experiments (total N = 5,542) tested this\nhypothesized framework.Table 1 provides an overview.\nFirst, Experiment 1 sought to con\ufb01rm Klein and O\u2019Brien\u2019s (2018)\nbasic \u201cquicker to judge\u201d effect in social judgment contexts. We held\nall information exactly constant but manipulated whether it was\npresented in a packed versus unpacked format. Thus, because\nall information is explicitly identical, with no extra layers to\nunpack, the unpacking manipulation here simply serves to increase\nits salience and thus its support\u2014 and so we hypothesized that\nunpacked participants will be\u201cquicker to judge\u201d relative to packed\nparticipants.\nNext, Experiments 2a\u22125b sought to test our key research question:\nDoes this discrepancy re\ufb02ect a universal effect of being\u201cquicker\u201d to\njudge? Or, as we hypothesize, does it depend on the support provided\nby what exactly is unpacked? According to our theorizing, unpacked\nexperiences that elicit higher support should indeed produce a\n\u201cquicker to judge\u201d effect while those that elicit lower support should\ninstead produce a\u201cslower to judge\u201d effect. We tested this hypoth-\nesis across various reward and punishment contexts, spanning\nthree sources of support\u2014 the emotionality of the unpacked behaviors\n(i.e., how much positive or negative emotion they elicit), the clearness\nof the unpacked behaviors (i.e., how clearly good or bad they seem),\nand the consistency of the unpacked behaviors (i.e., how consistently\nthey play out)\u2014 each of which should feed into support upon being\nunpacked and thus promoteeither effect, with higher levels hastening\njudgment and lower levels slowing judgment.\nFinally, Experiments 6a\u22126b shifted to a different question: While\nour prior set of experiments tested conditions for threshold viola-\ntions, this set tested downstream consequences for speci\ufb01c examples\nfrom the real world. We tested, for example, whether violating one\u2019s\nsocial judgment threshold can risk damaging people\u2019s reputations\nand relationships (e.g., by disrupting learning, making one seem\nhypocritical, and inviting retaliation).\nFor all experiments, we report all measures, manipulations, and\nexclusions (if any). We predetermined sample sizes by conducting a\npower analysis (G*Power; Faul et al., 2007)o fa l ls e v e ns t u d i e s\nreported inKlein and O\u2019Brien (2018); the average size of their key\neffect was d = 0.81, yielding a recommended cell size of 41\nparticipants for comparing two means (two-tailed,\u03b1 = 0.05, 95%\npower). Using this number as a reference point, we rounded up (to 50)\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely

as\u201cpacked\nversus unpacked\u201d and \u201cthreshold\u201d judgments. Also, our preregistra-\ntions for Experiments 2a\u22122b\u22123a\u22123b included supplementary medi-\nation analyses, which worked as predicted (see OSF for these results).\nExperiment 1: Unpacking Social Judgment\nIn Experiment 1, we assessed thresholds for drawing disposi-\ntional attributions. Participants evaluated a target who repeatedly\ncommitted the same good or bad act, and indicated their threshold\nfor judging the target as a good or bad actor\u2014 as a function of\nevaluating those behaviors all together up front (i.e., packed) or as\nthey unfolded one by one (i.e.,unpacked). We hypothesized that\npredicted thresholds would be higher than actual thresholds \u2014\nbecause in this basic unpacking task, all information is explicitly\nidentical and thus the unpacked (vs. packed) condition simply\nincreases the salience of each relevant piece, providing more\nsupport.

InKlein and O\u2019Brien (2018), the typical\nstudy asked predictor participants to report predictions on a larger\nscale than experiencer participants could report on (e.g., asking\npredictors, \u201cHow many consecutive behaviors, of 10, would lead\nyou to tip?\u201d vs. asking experiencers, after each behavior,\u201cHave you\ntipped yet?\u201d [and counting until they clicked\u201cyes\u201d over \u201cno\u201d])\u2014\nmeaning that random error had worked in favor of their\u201cquicker to\njudge\u201d hypothesis.

This result is incidental to the current research, but it\nis consistent with the valence asymmetry we have found in our\nprevious research on threshold judgments (Klein & O\u2019Brien, 2016;\nO\u2019Brien, 2020, 2022; O\u2019Brien & Klein, 2017)\u2014 a point to which we\nwill return in the General Discussion.\nSecond, and more critical for the current research, there was also\nthe hypothesized main effect Judgment Type,\u03b2 = \u22120.31, SE = .07,\np < .001\u2014 which emerged across Valence (null interaction:\u03b2 =\n0.02, SE = .07, p = .830). Pairwise comparisons reveal that Packed\nparticipants were more likely to predict they would withhold\njudgment after the target exhibited the same behavior for Observa-\ntions 1\u20133, as compared to what Unpacked participants reported\nafter experiencing Observations 1\u20133 one by one. When observing\nthree consecutive good acts, more Unpacked participants (48.08%,\n100 of 208) judged the target as a good person, as compared to the\nnumber of Packed participants who thought they would pass\njudgment at this point (33.84%, 67 of 198),\u03b2 = \u22120.30, SE =\n.10, p = .004; when observing three consecutive bad acts, more\nUnpacked participants (56.87%, 120 of 211) judged the target as a\nbad person, as compared to the number of Packed participants who\nthought they would pass judgment at this point (40.64%, 76 of\n187), \u03b2 = \u22120.33, SE = .10, p = .001.\nOther Variables\nMost participants passed the attention checks (valence: 91.92%,\n739 of 804;\u201c\ufb01rst/last\u201d: 70.90%, 570 of 804); reported their genuine\nthreshold (92.91%, 747 of 804); and passed the honesty check\n(98.51%, 792 of 804). When rerunning our analyses while excluding\nparticipants who failed any of these checks (leavingN = 489),\nresults are unchanged (main effect of Judgment Type:\u03b2 = \u22120.28,\nSE = .09, p = .002).\nExperiment 1 con\ufb01rms Klein and O\u2019Brien\u2019s (2018) \u201cquicker to\njudge\u201d effect.

Unpacking a positive interaction led participants to\nsoften their packed promotion thresholds\u2014 but participants did so\nto a lesser degree when that unpacked support was blunted.\nExperiment 3b: Banning Message-Board Users\nExperiment 3b resembled Experiment 3a but focused on banning\nthresholds. Participants set a threshold for how many negative\nmessage-board interactions (e.g., trolling) a user must commit before\nbeing banned. We hypothesized that participants would set harsher\n(i.e., lower) banning thresholds after seeing one such negative\ninteraction unfold (Unpacked condition) versus merely imagining\nit all up front (Packed condition), with the former providing more\nsupport (via negative emotion).\nWe also assessed another Unpacked condition, conceptually resem-\nbling the Unpacked-Blunted condition in Experiment 3a. Here, parti-\ncipants also saw one such negative interaction unfold (as opposed\nto imagining it up front), but they saw a different negative interaction\nfrom the one that our full Unpacked participants saw\u2014 one that was\nweakly negatively charged. We refer to this as the\u201cUnpacked-Weak\u201d\ncondition, as this particular post should elicit weaker reactions among\nparticipants\u2014 and therefore provide lower unpacked support as com-\npared to our full Unpacking condition. As in Experiment 3a, we\nhypothesized that this manipulation should attenuate the effect (i.e.,\nthat Unpacked-Weak participants might set thresholds that fall some-\nwhere in between our full Unpacked participants and our Packed\nparticipants).\nMoreover, we further speculated in our preregistration that this\nUnpacked-Weak condition might even\ufb02ip the effect, given that it\nuses an entirely different stimulus from the Unpacked condition (as\nopposed to using the same stimulus but blacking parts out to blunt\nreactions, as in Experiment 3a). That is, Unpacked-Weak partici-\npants might go beyond setting less-harsh thresholds than Unpacked\nparticipants (as in Experiment 3a)\u2014 here they might even set less-\nharsh thresholds thanPacked participants, if the speci\ufb01c stimulus we\nused happens to provide objectively low (not just relatively lower)\nsupport.

A set of\ntwo pairwise contrasts con\ufb01rmed this pattern. First, Unpacked\nparticipants reported more support than Packed and Unpacked-\nWeak participants (contrast weights: Packed=+ 2; Unpacked =\n\u22121; Unpacked-Weak = \u22121), t(282) = 3.63, p < .001, d = 0.43.\nSecond, Unpacked-Weak participants reported less support than\nUnpacked participants (contrast weights: Packed= 0; Unpacked=\n\u22121; Unpacked-Weak =+ 1), t(282) = 4.96, p < .001, d = 0.59.\nMain Results: Threshold Behavior. Next, we conducted an\nANOVA with Judgment Type (Packed vs. Unpacked vs. Unpacked-\nWeak) as the independent variable and banning threshold (banned\nafter 1 strike through 10 strikes) as the dependent variable.\nAs hypothesized, there was a signi\ufb01cant omnibus effect of Judg-\nment Type,F(2, 282)= 11.56,p < .001, \u03b72p = .08. Packed participants\nbelieved our banning threshold should be about 3\u20134 strikes (M = 3.49,\nSD = 2.02)\u2014 yet Unpacked participants set harsher thresholds,\nlowering them by about one strike (M = 2.76, SD = 2.12). Moreover,\namong the Unpacked-Weak condition, this effect was not just\nattenuated\u2014 it \ufb02ipped.

When rerunning our analyses while excluding participants who\nfailed either check, or reported unfair expectations (leavingN =\n247), results are unchanged, Omnibus effect of Judgment Threshold\non support: F(2, 244) = 16.75, p < .001, \u03b72p = .12; on banning\nthreshold: F(2, 244) = 14.56, p < .001, \u03b72p = .11.\nExperiment 3b builds on Experiment 3a by extending to banning\ncontexts, further generalizing our\ufb01ndings. Unpacking led partici-\npants to set different banning thresholds than Packed participants\u2014\nbut in different ways depending on what was unpacked.\nNext, we move beyond emotion to other potential inputs into\nsupport. We also shift to within-subject designs, with the same\nparticipants setting a packed threshold and then responding to an\nunpacked piece. Throughout, we further test differential effects of\nunpacking, such that it should hastenor slow judgment depending\non the support provided by what is unpacked (despite participants\nknowing about those unpacked possibilities beforehand). Other\nsuch inputs into support are how clearly good or bad unpacked\nbehaviors seem (Experiment 4), and how consistently they play out\n(Experiments 5a\u22125b)\u2014 both of which we assess next.\nExperiment 4: Clearness of Goodness/Badness\nAs an Input Into Support\nBack in Experiment 3b\u2019s Unpacked-Weak condition, recall that\nwe had showed participants a less-nasty\u201ctrolling\u201d stimulus (relative\nto the blatantly nasty stimulus that we had showed Unpacked\nparticipants)\u2014 which we did in order to test the idea that viewing\na less-nasty stimulus should elicit weaker emotional reactions\namong viewers and thereby provide less support. Taking a step\nback, however, note that\u2014 as we have emphasized throughout\u2014 our\nsupport-based theorizing is not restricted to the emotion piece itself.\nLower (vs. higher) support in Experiment 3b could have also come\nfrom other sources\u2014 such as from having had the knowledge that,\nby design, one of these stimuli was clearly less (vs. more) nasty than\nthe other (independent of one\u2019s emotional reactions per se).\nExperiment 4 tested this idea: How clearly good or bad an\nunpacked event seems might serve as its own input into support\nthat alters threshold judgments accordingly.

The\ndescription of each target followed the same format, except we\nrotated through our manipulations of interest. We varied (a) who\ncommitted the threshold-action (Target); (b) whether this action\ninvolved the target violating or adhering to their threshold (Thresh-\nold Behavior); (c) what the target did upon judgment (Judge How);\nand (d) whether the target was judging others\u2019good or bad behavior\n(Valence). We included these various manipulations simply for\ngeneralizability; across them, we hypothesized that these violations\nmay elicit worse evaluations of the threshold setter.\nTo take one concrete example, all participants evaluated the follow-\ning target\u2014 which was amanager(Target); who wasquickerto judge\ntheir employee (Threshold Behavior); in terms ofpunishing them\n(Judge How); for the employee\u2019s repeatedbad behavior (Valence):\nImagine the following. First: A manager establishes a clear cut-off for\nan employee\u2019s bad behavior (\u201c3 bad acts and I\u2019ll punish you\u201d). Then: As\nit turns out, the manager acts sooner than their established cut-off (They\npunish the employee after\u201c2 bad acts\u201d).\nFor our dependent variable, participants then rated this target\nvia a \ufb01ve-item Reputation block (items presented in randomized\norder), with each item rated from 1 (disagree)t o5(agree;w i t h3=\nit depends). The \ufb01ve items (phrased for this target, for example)\nwere, (a)This manager is a hypocrite;( b )This manager has hurt\nthe employee\u2019s ability to accurately learn from experience;( c )\nThis manager acted unfairly;( d )This manager held the employee\nto different standards than they hold other employees; and (e)\nThis manager shouldn\u2019t be trusted for setting future rules like\nthis. Across these parameters, we hypothesized that Threshold\nBehavior\u2014 namely, threshold inconsistencies (quicker or slower\nto judge) versus threshold consistencies\u2014 may elicit more nega-\ntive reputational assessments of the threshold setter.\nAll 60 events (and the phrasing of their dependent measures)\nfollowed this same format, except we manipulated each parameter\nwhere it appeared. For Target, we rotated through\ufb01ve kinds. Parents\ninteracted with their children; teachers interacted with their students;\nmanagers interacted with their employees; policymakers interacted\nwith citizens; and laypeople interacted with peers. For Threshold\nBehavior and Valence, all targets always set a threshold of\u201c3 good\nacts\u201d or \u201c3 bad acts,\u201d and acted either sooner by one such act\n(\u201c2g o o da c t s\u201d; \u201c3 bad acts\u201d); acted later by one such act (\u201c4g o o d\nacts\u201d; \u201c4 bad acts\u201d); or acting right at that threshold (\u201c3 good\nacts\u201d; \u201c3 bad acts\u201d; we made these inconsistencies always off by\n\u00b11 from 3 to allow for a more conservative test\u2014 the degree of\nthese \u201cviolations \u201d is small, and each target commits them just\nonce).

Such everyday evaluations highlight the role of people\u2019s\nunderlying thresholds for passing social judgment. The results of 10\nexperiments (see Table 2 for a data summary) reveal that people\noften violate their preset thresholds, even after formally establishing\nthem based on having full information about what might unfold.\nMoreover, we propose a framework to understand these threshold\nviolations, which we test across many contexts, behaviors, and\ndesigns (including within-subjects designs, with people violating\ntheir own preset thresholds). All told, our central\ufb01nding is that\npeople are swayed to be\u201cquicker\u201d and \u201cslower\u201d to judge than they\ndeclare beforehand\u2014 both as a function of unpacked psychological\nsupport.\nTheoretical Contributions\nOur \ufb01ndings advanceKlein and O\u2019Brien (2018)initial claim that\npeople are quicker to judge than they think. First, we examine many\nsocial judgment domains using experimental designs that match the\nmeasurement of the dependent variable across conditions, largely\ninvolving ecologically valid thresholds for real behavior (e.g.,\nissuing/withholding rewards and punishments). Second, Klein\nand O\u2019Brien (2018) neither tested nor discussedwhy people are\n\u201cquicker to judge than they think,\u201d aside from broadly speculating\nthat real-time judgment may be swayed by a\u201cSystem 1 suite of\naffective responses designed to provide rapid online feedback about\nthe current environment\u201d (p. 13222) that is too subtle to appreciate\nin prospect. In contrast, we put forth a novel theoretical account that\nintegrates the psychology underlying the time course and formation\nof these everyday social judgments. Using the logic of support\ntheory (Tversky & Koehler, 1994) to model these dynamics, we\nreveal thatKlein and O\u2019Brien\u2019s (2018)account is incomplete, and\ninstead is one part of a broader framework: People can be swayed to\nbe \u201cquicker\u201d and \u201cslower\u201d to judge both as a function ofsupport\n(which need not be constrained to\u201cSystem 1\u201d inputs).\nOur \ufb01ndings raise fruitful insights into the psychological effects\nof thresholds writ large. Findings in other areas of psychology\nemphasize that reference points and comparison standards exert\nsubstantial in\ufb02uence over people\u2019s judgments (e.g.,Kahneman &\nTversky, 1979).

Findings in other areas of psychology\nemphasize that reference points and comparison standards exert\nsubstantial in\ufb02uence over people\u2019s judgments (e.g.,Kahneman &\nTversky, 1979). The kinds of thresholds assessed in the current\nresearch\u2014 which essentially re\ufb02ect how people think about stan-\ndards for acceptable and unacceptable behavior\u2014 may represent a\nsimilarly important focus of research, especially since people appar-\nently do not always adhere to them. Given that meaningful social\njudgments often comprise repeated interactions (e.g., involving\nforming conclusions based on recurring observations of a colleague\nor acquaintance, as opposed to one-shot judgments of an isolated\nstranger), our \ufb01ndings further highlight that moving beyond one-\nshot study designs to more dynamic paradigms might reveal unfore-\nseen changes in preferences and behaviors as things unfold.\nOur \ufb01ndings also contribute to research on reducing stereotyp-\ning and discrimination. A major theme from this research is that\nreducing such biases requ ires reducing ambiguity \u2014 not just\nthrough gaining more knowledge about the target of judgment\nbut also through more clearly establishing one\u2019s judgment criteria\nbeforehand (e.g., \u201cThus, discrimination typically occurs when\nsocially appropriate behavior is not clearly de\ufb01ned \u2026\u201d : Hodson et\nal., 2002,p .4 6 1 ;\u201cHaving committed to unambiguous criteria,\n[evaluators] will be unable to de\ufb01ne merit to the bene\ufb01t of speci\ufb01c\njob candidates\u2026 Our research thus demonstrates the ef\ufb01cacy of a\nmethod to reduce job discrimination: the establishment of stan-\ndards of merit prior to the review of candidates\u201d; Uhlmann &\nCohen, 2005,p p .4 7 8\u2013479). Our \ufb01ndings warn that, even after\nestablishing a concrete system that predetermines judgment\nthresholds, people may nonetheless violate them as each good\nor bad behavior unfolds piece by piece. Evaluation systems that\nappear fairly improved on the surface, but still yield selectively\nquick or slow enforcement, will require a closer look.\nBeyond social judgment, our\ufb01ndings also contribute to research\non motivation, which has similarly drawn on the logic of support\ntheory to understand people\u2019s failures to attain goals. People often\nset goals to\ufb01nish tasks by a certain date, but then run late; unpacking\nindividual hurdles can lead people to predict longer (and thus poten-\ntially more accurate) completion times (e.g.,Connolly & Dean, 1997;\nForsyth & Burt, 2008; Kruger & Evans, 2004). People often set goals\nto consume a certain number of calories, but then overeat; unpacking\nindividual meals can lead people to predict bigger (and thus potentially\nmore accurate) intake (e.g.,Jia et al., 2020, Study 4). People often\nset goals to save a certain amount of money, but then overspend;\nunpacking individual purchases can lead people to predict bigger\n(and thus potentially more accurate) expenses (e.g.,Howard et al.,\n2022; Peetz et al., 2015); and so on. Such examples can be more\nbroadly understood through the lens of our framework\u2014 all essen-\ntially highlighting cases in which people violate self-set thresholds.\nOur \u201cquicker to judge\u201d versus \u201cslower to judge\u201d terminology may\nalso help integrate competing effects in this research. For example,\nunpacking tasks indeed mitigate the planning fallacy when they\nunpack lengthy delays (essentially,\u201cquicker to judge\u201d)\u2014 but worsen\nthe planning fallacy when they unpack atypically short delays\n(essentially, \u201cslower to judge \u201d: Hadjichristidis et al., 2014 ).\nTogether, these \ufb01ndings suggest our framework should apply\nThis document is copyrighted by

In contrast to policymakers, the citizens affected by\npredetermined policies could feel differently once the relevant\nbehaviors start to occur; dif\ufb01culties in maintaining public support\nmay partly re\ufb02ect the discrepant mode of judgment between how\npeople make policy (e.g., presetting a threshold that can be enforced\nacross many possible outcomes) versus how people experience\npolicy (e.g., reacting to the speci\ufb01c outcomes that happen to unfold,\nin real time). Such discrepancies may be at the root of many kinds of\ncon\ufb02ict and miscommunication, with different parties calling for\nreward or punishment at different times and contexts. One study\nfound that people are especially likely to derogate others as hypo-\ncrites when they\ufb01rst proclaim the value of good behavior and then\nbehave badly (vs. the other way around:Barden et al., 2005)\u2014\nsuggesting that the kinds of violations observed in our research\n(which conceptually resemble this\u201cproclaim \ufb01rst, behave second\u201d\norder of operations) may be especially likely to garner social stigma.\nIt is also interesting to consider the potential connection between\nour \ufb01ndings (i.e., a ready willingness among evaluators to violate\ntheir agreed-upon thresholds) and understanding the challenges\npeople might face in navigating evolving social standards for\nappropriate behavior. In today\u2019s information age, people\u2019s present\nactions are widely documented (e.g., on social media) for future eyes\nto see and judge. If what counts as good or bad shifts over time\n(as it often does:Ronson, 2016), people could routinely run into\nunforeseen reputational challenges for having committed identical\nbehavior. For example, as put in our terms, society at Time 1 might\n\u201cpreset\u201d what counts as socially appropriate; yet society at Time 2\nmay have changed to lower this threshold for offense and thus\nchastise a past-appropriate-actor anyway \u2014 essentially re\ufb02ecting\nour \u201cquicker to judge\u201d effect.\nFuture Directions\nOther Inputs?\nAnother bene\ufb01t of our model is that one can use it to make\npredictions about any variable so long as one knows how it bears\non support: Psychological inputs that increase (vs. decrease) support\nshould \u201chasten\u201d(vs. \u201cslow\u201d) judgment thresholds, even in cases when\npeople have full information of those possibilities when establishing\ntheir thresholds beforehand.\nOne such input is diagnosticity (e.g.,Skowronski & Carlston,\n1987, 1989). In the ability domain, for instance, positive (vs.\nnegative) behaviors are typically more diagnostic for discriminat-\ning between alternative trait categorizations and thus elicit posi-\ntivity biases in social judgment (e.g., upon observing someone\nsolve a complicated math problem, judges tend to infer the person\nmust be a math whiz\u2014 because a nonwhiz cannot solve it; in contrast,\nobserving someone struggle for a solution is weighted less heavily in\nability judgments, because math whizzes can also struggle); but in the\nmorality domain, negative (vs. positive) behaviors are typically the\nmore diagnostic ones and thus elicit negativity biases (e.g., upon\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nTable 2 (continued)\nExperiment Goal of study Sample Setting Study design Key finding Summary\nExperiment 6b Test downstream\nconsequences\n(controlled stimuli)\nN = 100 P\u2019s (34% women;\n25% non-White;M = 38\nyears old)\nHypothetical behavior Fully within subjects: 5\n(target: parent, teacher,\nmanager, policymaker,\nlayperson) \u00d7 3 (target\u2019s\nthreshold behavior: target\nwas quicker to judge vs.\nslower to judge vs.\naccurate) \u00d7 2 (judge how:\npoint when target viewed\nothers differently vs.\ntreated others differently)\u00d7\n2 (valence of judged\nbehavior: good behavior\nvs. bad behavior)\nEffect of target\u2019s\nthreshold behavior,\nwald = 341.68, df =\n2, p < .001\nThreshold violations\nundermined violators\u2019\nreputations\nNote.

Similarly, to the extent that personal experience with\nunpacked states exposes one to a diverse variety of them, then\nmore versus less experienced judges may tend to set more accurate\nthresholds; acquiring personal experience has been cited as one\nstrategy for closing \u201cempathy gaps\u201d (Van Boven et al., 2013).\nDiscrepancies may be reduced when those who set thresholds\n(e.g., policymakers) once walked in the shoes of affected parties\n(e.g., constituents).\nAt the same time, support theory research warns that it is\nimpractical to expect threshold setters to become calibrated on\ntheir own (\u201cPeople can be encouraged to unpack a category into its\ncomponents, but they cannot be expected to think of all relevant\nconjunctive unpackings or generate all relevant future scenarios\u201d:\nTversky & Koehler, 1994, p. 565). An easier strategy may be to\nrecruit intermediaries to enforce threshold adherence no matter\nhow much one wants to act or delay as things unfold (\u201cblind\njustice\u201d: Baron, 1995) .T h r e s h o l ds e t t e r sm a ya l s ob e n e\ufb01tf r o m\nsetting weighted thresholds if they can do so, akin to the\u201cpoints\u201d\nsystem embedded in many driving laws (whereby drivers get\npunished after hitting a preset violation threshold, but larger\ninfractions like drunk driving count more toward this threshold\nthan do smaller infractions like running a red light).\nAre Threshold Setters (Un)aware?\nThis support-based framework assumes presetters underappreci-\nate speci\ufb01c \ufb01tting cases (e.g., those at distributional tails) that\u2014 if\nunpacked and accounted for\u2014 may lead them to set thresholds that\nbetter consider what all could\ufb01t and unfold under their threshold.\nAn alternative explanation is that presetters fully appreciate such\ncases but choose to dismiss them. For example, perhaps their goal\nis to set a threshold around common cases but then adjust for\nunusual circumstances if those occur. Indeed, observing people\nviolate their thresholds need not mean they planned to adhere to\nthem. This possibility strikes us as unlikely to explain all our\n\ufb01ndings\u2014 and, even so, it may still invite problems (e.g., for the\nthreshold setter\u2019s reputation) if such allowances are not spelled out\nbeforehand (e.g., as in Experiments 6a\u22126b). In any case, this is an\nimportant question for future research to further tease apart. One\nway to do so would be to measure anticipated\ufb02exibility (e.g., by\nasking Packed participants to indicate how\ufb02exible their threshold\nis, separately from asking them to indicate the threshold itself).\nAnother way would be to test whether peoplerecalibrate their preset\nthresholds after an unpacking manipulation (echoing our proposed\n\u201cpersonal experience\u201d strategy for calibration); our support-based\nframework predicts people will recalibrate (e.g.,\u201cOh, right\u2014 my\nthreshold should account for this\u201d) while this alternative explanation\npredicts people will not recalibrate (e.g.,\u201cI already know this\u2014 Ij u s t\ndon\u2019t think it should affect my preset threshold\u201d).\nWhen Are Threshold Violations Adaptive?\nFinally, future research should further tease apart the downstream\nconsequences of threshold violations\u2014 both badand good.

Observers\nmay adjust their judgments depending on their own unpacked\nknowledge, consistent with our framework. Note, however, that\nExperiment 6b did provide participants the option of indicating\u201cit\ndepends\u201d yet they still passed judgment on the violator\u2014 suggesting\nobservers may not fully appreciate situational exceptions unless\nsuch exceptions are made explicit, which they often are not (Jones &\nNisbett, 1971). Second, Experiment 6a found no effects of parti-\ncipants being on the receiving end of threshold violations them-\nselves versus observing threshold violations happen to others, but\nhigher stakes contexts may reveal different patterns. Desires to\npunish rulebreakers (Tyler & Boeckmann, 1997) are presumably\nless strong when others break rules to bene\ufb01t oneself\u2014 perhaps\nexplaining why we did not\ufb01nd positive effects of threshold viola-\ntions in Experiment 6b (which assessed outside observers only). In\ngeneral, one can imagine that self-serving motivations should lead\npeople to be especially appreciative of others who are slower to\npunish them and quicker to reward them (e.g.,Thorndike, 1911).\nHowever, as we had noted in our Experiment 6a discussion, we\nfound mixed results for such effects; if anything, the results suggested\npeople might appreciate slow self-punishment but not necessarily\nquick self-reward. Such an asymmetry is consistent with theories of\nachievement motivation, which propose that people do not pursue\npleasurable outcomes mindlessly; they also derive utility from earning\nthem (e.g.,Higgins, 1997). In any case, more research is needed to\nbetter establish the badand good of threshold violations\u2014 including\ncases when violations help and adherences hurt (e.g., perhaps a\nteacher\u2019s reputation takes ahit for dutifully sticking to one\u2019s deadline\nfor a student who experiences a unique tragedy that prevents them\nfrom fairly earning it, as opposed togranting the student an extension).\nThese ideas emphasize a broader point about the bene\ufb01ts versus\ncosts of threshold violations. On the one hand, one may view threshold\nviolators as simply rationally adapting to new information\u2014 following\nthe Bayesian axiom\u201cWhen the facts change, I change my mind.\u201d On\nthe other hand, we believe there are at least two critical shortcomings to\nsuch a view. First, even in cases when threshold violations re\ufb02ect\nrational updating, violators may still encounter other costs (e.g., people\noften derogate others for updating social judgments based on Bayesian\nreasoning alone:Cao et al., 2019). Second, in principle (and as we\nhave emphasized throughout in our experiments), threshold presetters\nhave all the same information that threshold-followers do. That is, the\nthreshold violations in our research do not occur because of truly new\ninformation; rather, they occur because presetters fail account for\ncertain aspects of the information they already have. A more\ufb01tting\nsummary of our\ufb01ndings may therefore be that people follow the\naxiom \u201cWhen I\u2019m reminded of a known fact, I change my mind.\u201d\nThis is not the same as learning something truly new. Threshold\nviolations that occur in reaction to ostensibly agreed-upon (vs.\ntruly new) information may seem more unfair than fair.\nConcluding Thoughts\nEveryday social life often entails evaluating others against some\nthreshold for their behavior. Managers tell employees that, if they\nland a certain number of clients, they will get a bonus; parents tell\nchildren that, if they miss a certain number of chores, they will be\ngrounded; and so on. In less formal settings, too, people constantly\nhold others to certain expectations of good and bad behavior,\nguiding their reputations and relationships.\nThe current research asks: When do people pass such judgments?\nOur \ufb01ndings suggest the answer depends on the point at which\npeople are asked, raising novel insights into theory, policy, and\neveryday interactions.

Wright2\n1 Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis\n2 Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh\nAcross adulthood, people tend to experience psychologically adaptive personality trait change, a robust\n\ufb01nding known as the maturity principle of personality development. We identify three open areas of in-\nquiry regarding personality maturation and address them in a preregistered study, using a sample of U.\nS. adults ages 30\u201370 who completed a battery of personality questionnaires and were rated by two close\nothers twice over an 11- to 16-year period (Nwave1 = 1,785, Nwave2 = 401). First, it is unclear whether\nthe maturity principle applies to narrower facet-level traits, as there has been little research into facet de-\nvelopment across adulthood. We examined 47 facet scales and found that most developed adaptively\nacross ages 30\u201370, but some did not mature, and three healthy facets (activity, openness to feelings, and\nsocial potency) declined signi\ufb01cantly across adulthood, counter to the maturity principle. Second, no\nlongitudinal research has tested whether personality maturation is perceived similarly by close others.\nWe compared self- and other-rated development and found that close others perceived greater matura-\ntion than the self in Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and\ufb01ve facets. Finally, few studies\nhave examined whether traits comature in adulthood. We found that correlated change between healthy\nfacets was small in magnitude. Additionally, we found tighter comaturation in other-reported develop-\nment than self-reported development. We use these results and past research to expand and re\ufb01ne our\nunderstanding of personality maturation across adulthood.\nKeywords: personality traits, personality facets, lifespan development, personality development\nSupplemental materials:https://doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000400.supp\nAcross adulthood, most people tend to experience increases in\npersonality traits that are positively related to interpersonal and\noccupational functioning and health, such as Agreeableness, Con-\nscientiousness, and Emotional Stability (Bleidorn et al., 2013;\nRoberts et al., 2006; Specht et al., 2011). This\ufb01nding, termed the\nmaturity principle of personality development (Caspi et al., 2005;\nRoberts et al., 2008) has served as an organizational framework\nfor personality development research over the past 15 years. How-\never, at least three questions about personality maturation remain\nunaddressed. First, it is unclear whether the maturity principle\napplies to the narrower facet-level traits that make up each major\npersonality (e.g., Big Five) domain, as there has been surprisingly\nlittle research into personality facet development across adulthood\n(cf. Bleidorn et al., 2009; Costello et al., 2017; Terracciano et al.,\n2005). Second, it is unclear whether trait maturation plays out sim-\nilarly in the eyes of the self and close others. Past research indi-\ncates that close others may perceive less trait maturation than the\nself over time, but this has yet to be statistically tested (Oltmanns\net al., 2020; Lenhausen et al., 2020; Watson & Humrichouse,\n2006). Third, the extent to which personality traits comature\nwithin people is unclear. Personality traits may mature in tandem,\nindicating that maturation is a broad, coordinated process. Alterna-\ntively, traits may develop relatively independent of one another,\nwhich would be indicative of narrower, trait-speci\ufb01c processes\n(Klimstra et al., 2013; Soto & John, 2012).\nIn this study, we addressed these three questions and synthe-\nsized past research on personality development across adulthood\nto expand and re\ufb01ne the maturity principle of personality develop-\nment.

At both time\npoints, participants were also rated on their personality traits by\ntwo close others using the NEO Five-Factor-Inventory. We used\nthis rich set of personality trait data to test three hypotheses. First,\nwe tested whether narrower personality traits matured across early\nand middle adulthood. We hypothesized that most healthy traits\nwould increase, and most unhealthy facets would decrease, and we\nidenti\ufb01ed exceptions to this general trend. Second, we tested\nwhether trajectories of personality development reported by close\nothers were indeed less positive than trajectories of self-reported\npersonality development, at both the domain and facet level.\nThird, we explored the extent to which personality traits tended to\ncomature, both within and across perspectives of the self and\nother. Overall, these analyses contribute to the growing literature\non personality trait development below and beyond the Big Five\nand provide new information about personality maturation across\nadulthood.\nThe Maturity Principle\nThe maturity principle of personality development was articu-\nlated in a 2005 review by Caspi, Shiner, and Roberts, who wrote\nthat past research has found that\u201cMost people become more domi-\nnant, Agreeable, Conscientious, and Emotionally Stable over the\ncourse of their lives. These changes point to increasing psycholog-\nical maturity over development, from adolescence to middle age.\n[This de\ufb01nition] equates maturity with the capacity to become a\nproductive and involved contributor to society, with the process of\nbecoming more planful, deliberate, and decisive, but also more\nconsiderate and charitable\u201d (Caspi et al., 2005, pp. 468\u2013469).\nMore recent research has continued to provide support for this\nprinciple. Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and meta-analytic studies\nusing a variety of personality trait measures have consistently\nreplicated the trend of increasing Agreeableness and Conscien-\ntiousness and decreasing Neuroticism across early and middle\nadulthood, in samples from many (mostly western) nations, at\nboth the within-person level (i.e., in a person across time) and\nbetween-person level (i.e., when comparing different ages to one\nanother; Bleidorn et al., 2015;Costello et al., 2017; Lucas & Don-\nnellan, 2011; Specht et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2006; Wortman et\nal., 2012; Wright et al., 2011; cf.Graham et al., 2020). Research-\ners have also found that the maturity principle applies to other\ntraits emblematic of the ability to be a productive, psychologically\nhealthy member of society, like achievement (Donnellan et al.,\n2007), honesty/humility (Costello et al., 2017), (low) severity of\npersonality disorders (Woods et al., 2019), and (low) psychopathy\nand narcissism (Zettler et al., 2020). This body of evidence makes\nthe maturity principle one of the most strongly supported\ufb01ndings\nin personality development (Roberts & Nickel, 2017).\nMore recent\ufb01ndings have re\ufb01ned our understanding of personal-\nity maturation. For example, there is often a temporary disruption\nof adaptive development in adolescence, followed by dramatic\nincreases in healthy traits at the beginning of adulthood (Klimstra et\nal., 2018; Luan et al., 2018; Soto & Tackett, 2015;c f .Brandes et\nal., 2020). Furthermore, the extent to which adaptive development\ncontinues into older adulthood seems to depend on sample compo-\nsition (Mueller et al., 2016; Specht et al., 2011); development in\nthis stage of life may be best construed in terms of years until death\n(Wagner et al., 2016). These results add granularity to the original\nassertion that maturation occurs across the life span\u2014 speci\ufb01cally,\nadaptive development appears to occur from late adolescence up to\nthe years before death. These\ufb01ndings open the door for further re-\nvision of the maturity principle so that it more comprehensively\nsummarizes life span trends in adaptive personality development.\nWe have identi\ufb01ed three open questions about personality matura-\ntion, which we now turn to as the focus of this study.\nHow Do Narrower Personality Facets Mature?\nPersonality traits can be organized at multiple hierarchical lev-\nels.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4181, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00867508-e148-4d6e-97d8-e05488c9b1d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "00867508-e148-4d6e-97d8-e05488c9b1d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e4343a5-7ece-4a93-a95a-5fbbd8c1b3f7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "e48098310007908af325c158a3aa580d2f36399a35c6053930cf14daa7a99867", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c73c71dd-0025-4090-9db4-5526d106657e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "fa5c5bb58b0e271554eea24d8c011e75fb396be0fecbaa4e284bcdfa088f7599", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "These results add granularity to the original\nassertion that maturation occurs across the life span\u2014 speci\ufb01cally,\nadaptive development appears to occur from late adolescence up to\nthe years before death.

In modern research on personality development, researchers\ntypically conceptualize traits in terms of the Big Five, which strike\na parsimonious balance between bandwidth and\ufb01delity (John et\nal., 2008). Using the Big Five as a template, researchers have\nsketched a high-level portrait of developmental trends (e.g.,Rob-\nerts et al., 2006). The next logical step is to describe development\nin terms of the narrower facet-level traits that make up the Big\nFive, which will provide a higher-\ufb01delity understanding of life\nspan development (Schwaba et al., 2020). For example, although\nNeuroticism typically decreases across the life span, facets of Neu-\nroticism, such as depressiveness and angry hostility, may develop\ndifferently from one another.\nDescribing development at the facet level allows researchers to\nfurther test and revise the maturity principle. Different facets may\nmature at different rates and different ages, which contributes in-\nformation about the processes underlying life span development\n(M\u00f5ttus et al., 2020 ). For example, tender-mindedness and\nstraightforwardness are both healthy facets of Agreeableness,\nthough the former is more strongly associated with personal\ngrowth (Anglim et al., 2020) and the latter with (lesser) antisocial\nbehavior (Vize et al., 2018). By separately examining develop-\nment in these traits, researchers can disambiguate two different\nforms of maturation in Agreeableness. Furthermore, facet-level\nexamination allows researchers to decouple the general concept of\ntrait maturation from change speci\ufb01cally in Agreeableness, Consci-\nentiousness, and Neuroticism. Indeed, facets exist on a continuum\nof adaptiveness: Some are especially relevant to psychological\nhealth and interpersonal functioning (e.g., depressiveness, gregari-\nousness), and others are less so (e.g., openness to fantasy, excite-\nment-seeking; Bleidorn et al., 2020). Even within a domain, facets\noften differ in their relevance to maturity. For example, within Con-\nscientiousness, the facet of self-discipline has a stronger negative\nassociation with personality disorder symptoms than the facet of\ncompliance (Samuel & Widiger, 2008). And, although the domains\nof Extraversion and Openness are often considered to be neutrally\nadaptive and therefore outside the scope of the maturity principle,\nsome facets underlying the domains of Extraversion and Openness,\nsuch as gregariousness and openness to feelings, are especially\nrelevant to the mature, healthy personality (Bleidorn et al., 2020).\nUsing this variance across facets, we classify each narrower trait\nas either healthy, unhealthy, or neutral, regardless of its parent do-\nmain. Facet-level examination can thus provide information about\n1 In this article, we consider healthy and mature traits to be synonymous\nbecause we de \ufb01ne trait maturation as adaptive increases in healthy\npersonality traits and decreases in unhealthy personality traits. We\nrecognize that some perspectives disambiguate these two qualities (e.g.,\nHogan & Roberts, 2004; Ryff, 1989; Walker & Pitts, 1998).\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nREFINING THE MATURITY PRINCIPLE 943", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3571, "end_char_idx": 7497, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a8b2a60-9205-45b0-b55b-0544d0174a3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a8b2a60-9205-45b0-b55b-0544d0174a3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b90c7681-054d-45e0-9e91-93bb61699a90", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "fd5f3e2d6ca6c469eea0cb3536b14f92bee6551bfa7ec86d3e55fb102ab8afe4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f1ee464b-99e2-4791-bf1d-9a3c7b7f6b60", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c09cd5c1df3d38df5a0104c2755e43bb4cee5ee345f6335ecd18ff69800e3331", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "whether the age-graded developmental patterns observed in past\nresearch are truly due to adaptive development in healthy traits\nacross the personality spectrum or merely change in certain per-\nsonality domains.\nTo date, however, there has been little research into Big Five\nfacet development across adulthood (Bleidorn et al., 2009; Cost-\nello et al., 2017; Klimstra et al., 2018; Soto & John, 2012; Terrac-\nciano et al., 2005 ), and no research has explicitly tested\nhypotheses related to facet-level personality maturation. In one\nstudy, Terracciano et al. found that, although Agreeableness, Con-\nscientiousness, and Neuroticism developed adaptively across ages\n30 to 90, the underlying facets measured by the NEO Personality\nInventory\u2014 Revised (NEO-PI-R) often exhibited different trajec-\ntories. Framing these results in terms of maturation, the facets of\nmodesty, achievement-striving, and gregariousness did not show\nadaptive age-graded increases, and self-discipline and activity\nshowed maladaptive decreases. Bleidorn et al. (2009) also pro-\nvided evidence that some NEO-PI-R facets may not develop adap-\ntively in middle adulthood among a twin sample measured over 10\nyears. This sample displayed adaptive development in most traits,\nbut the facet of tender-mindedness did not increase over time, and\ngregariousness decreased, on average. This general pattern of\nresults, where facets develop differentially and some fail to\nmature, generalizes to the remaining three studies.Klimstra et al.\n(2018) found no evidence for adaptive increases in positive affect,\nsociability, and activity across two college samples, and one sam-\nple increased maladaptively in anxiety throughout college.Soto\nand John (2012)found no evidence of adaptive increases in order-\nliness, anxiety, irritability, and social con\ufb01dence in a sample of\nwomen across ages 20\u201360, and participants tended to decrease in\ngregariousness as they grew older. Finally,Costello et al. (2017)\nfound that orderliness and enthusiasm did not increase adaptively\nwith age across the ages 20 to 60 in an online sample.\nThese studies are complemented by three additional investiga-\ntions into facets of the Multidimensional Personality Question-\nnaire (MPQ) in young adult samples. Donnellan et al. (2007)\nfound maladaptive decreases in the traits of well-being, social po-\ntency, and social closeness across ages 18 to 28,Roberts et al.\n(2001) found maladaptive decreases in social closeness and no\nchange in stress reaction across ages 18 to 26, andBlonigen et al.\n(2008) found evidence for maturation in all healthy traits besides\nsocial potency across ages 17 to 24.\nWhen taken together, these studies reveal common patterns and\nareas for future inquiry. Though these studies sampled from differ-\nent (western) populations and measured personality using different\ninstruments, each found substantial heterogeneity in facet develop-\nment, even among facets that were highly correlated at baseline\nand associated with the same higher-order domain. This result\nindicates that important information about life span development\ncan be found in distinctions within the broader personality\ndomains. Additionally, in each study, some facets indicative of a\nmature personality did not increase across adulthood, and a few\nhealthy facets\u2014 often, those relating to an active and sociable life-\nstyle\u2014 declined with age. However, these results come with major\ncaveats.

There-\nfore, both self- and other-reports of personality development pro-\nvide important information about the extent to which someone has\nmatured. However, nearly all evidence brought to bear on the ma-\nturity principle to date has come from self-reports.\nFew researchers to date have compared adult personality devel-\nopment in self- and informant-report data (Oltmanns et al., 2020;\nLenhausen et al., 2020; Watson & Humrichouse, 2006). In one\nsample of U.S. newlyweds, self-reported increases in Agreeable-\nness, Conscientiousness, and Emotional Stability were countered\nby other-reported decreases in these domains across 2 years (Wat-\nson & Humrichouse, 2006). In a sample of Midwestern U.S. older\nadults, close others (half of whom were spouses) also perceived\ndecreases in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness over 6 years,\ncontrasting with self-reports (Oltmanns et al., 2020). Finally, in a\nsample of cohabiting Dutch couples, about half of whom became\nparents, partners perceived steeper decreases in Agreeableness and\nExtraversion than the self over 2 years (Lenhausen et al., 2020).\nAcross each of these three studies, not only did close others of-\nten perceive less maturation than the self over time, but they often\nperceived maladaptive development, especially in Agreeableness.\nThis pattern of results suggests that the self and close others may\nview a person\u2019s personality changes over time in quite different\nways. By comparing trends in both domain- and facet-level per-\nsonality development across the perspective of the self and close\nothers, we can enrich our understanding of how personality matu-\nration is perceived in the context of close relationships.\nDo Personality Traits Comature?\nThe maturity principle was initially formulated to summarize a\npopulation-level trend that occurs across a wide variety of healthy\ntraits. However, little is known about whether these traits tend to\ndevelop together within a person. When a person experiences\nadaptive change in one personality trait, do they tend to experience\nadaptive change in others as well? If traits tend to comature, it\nwould indicate that maturation can be conceptualized as a broad,\ngeneral phenomenon that affects trait development similarly\nacross people (Soto & John, 2012). Such a\ufb01nding would allow\nresearchers to search for broadly acting mechanisms underlying\nthis process, such as change in serotonergic functioning (Klimstra\net al., 2013; Wright et al., 2019) or normative life events (Bleidorn\net al., 2013; Lodi-Smith & Roberts, 2007). Furthermore, strong\ncomaturation would indicate that adaptive trait development could\nbe usefully summarized and studied at this broad level. On the\nother hand, \ufb01nding that adaptive traits do not tend to codevelop\nwould indicate that maturation likely involves many trait-speci\ufb01c\nprocesses, where people experience adaptive change in different\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nSCHWABA, BLEIDORN, HOPWOOD, MANUCK, AND WRIGHT944", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3376, "end_char_idx": 7450, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f8973b3-7f45-41f7-92fe-9e32e232d2cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f8973b3-7f45-41f7-92fe-9e32e232d2cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2461d8cc-3531-43e6-9897-af5fe382ecaf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "0490edf0c390585e90b751795577bd7c35a936ccc852686340af39ae0be998e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "23a05279-b5c9-4563-811c-f6ea6a45f53b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "722d55d4c5a176fd7ae6660ca4380fc2383fdcb6051618b498aacc25eee0b9c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "traits at different rates. Such a\ufb01nding would suggest that adaptive\ntrait development is mostly driven by many narrowly-acting mech-\nanisms (e.g., a certain mechanism may affect some facets of Con-\nscientiousness but not others) that may have differential effects\nacross people (e.g., a certain mechanism may make one person\nmore Conscientious, but make another person more Agreeable).\nThus, understanding comaturation is both descriptively and theo-\nretically useful.\nTo date, there has been little research into correlated change\nbetween personality traits in adulthood, limiting our knowledge of\ncomaturation (Allemand & Martin, 2017). Most researchers exam-\nining comaturation have done so at the level of the Big Five, and\ntwo studies have provided evidence for comaturation.Klimstra et\nal. (2013) studied a large, representative sample of Germans and\nfound stronger correlated change among Agreeableness, Conscien-\ntiousness, and Neuroticism (meanr = j.30j) than among other Big\nFive domains across a 4-year period, a\ufb01nding that was robust\nacross age groups. Furthermore,L\u00fcdtke et al. (2011)found that\nAgreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Extraversion\ncodeveloped across college (meanr = j.33j), whereas Openness to\nExperience developed independently of these traits. This\ufb01nding\nalso provides some evidence for comaturation, but because Extra-\nversion consists of healthy (e.g., positive affect) and neutral\n(excitement-seeking) facets, it is unclear whether codevelopment\nbetween Extraversion and other traits was attributable to comatu-\nration. These studies are matched by two others that show little\nevidence for comaturation.Allemand et al. (2008)studied a sam-\nple of older German adults measured over a 12-year period and\nfound strong correlated change among all traits besides Neuroti-\ncism (mean r = j.54j), which does not suggest comaturation but\ninstead a decoupling of development between healthy and unheal-\nthy traits. Similarly, M\u00f5ttus et al. (2012)found that codevelop-\nment among Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism\nwas small in magnitude (meanr = j.17j) and no larger than corre-\nlated change among other Big Five traits from ages 81 to 89.\nFinally, Soto and John (2012)found that facets tended to code-\nvelop within domains, but not across domains, in a small sample\nof U.S. women followed across early and middle adulthood, which\nalso provides some evidence against comaturation (they did not\nexplicitly estimate correlated change among maturity-related\nfacets).\nAcross these studies, there is some evidence for correlated mat-\nuration at the level of the Big Five, which may suggest a shared\nmechanism underlying at least some adaptive age-graded trait de-\nvelopment. To improve our understanding of this phenomenon,\nmore research is needed that systematically quanti\ufb01es comatura-\ntion across two forms of evidence: convergent (to what extent are\nchanges in one maturity-relevant trait correlated with changes in\nother maturity-relevant traits?) and discriminant (do maturity-rele-\nvant traits codevelop more strongly than traits not relevant to\nmaturity?).\nWe address these questions using a large set of facets that are\ndifferentially relevant to maturity, allowing us to test comaturation\nwith high \ufb01delity. Additionally, close others may have comple-\nmentary or contrasting positions on comaturation.

Wave 1N = 1,771, Wave 2\nN = 393). For each item of the NEO-PI-R, participants rated the\nextent to which a characteristic applies to them (e.g.,\u201cI am some-\none who is outgoing\u201d) on a Likert scale from 1 =disagree strongly\nto 5 =agree strongly, and we computed scores for each domain\nand facet by averaging across items. Across both waves, internal\nconsistencies for NEO-PI-R scales were high (xt = .71\u2013.94, a =\n.62\u2013.93; see Table S1 in the online supplementary materials for\ncomplete descriptive information, including means andSDs).\nMultidimensional Personality Questionnaire\nParticipants also completed the 155-item short form of the Mul-\ntidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ; Patrick et al.,\n2002), which measures three broad personality superfactors and\n11 narrower personality subfactors (which we refer to as facets)\nthat were developed separately from the Big Five (Wave 1N =\n1,289, Wave 2N = 386). For each MPQ item, participants read a\nstatement (e.g.,\u201cI can be deeply moved by a sunset\u201d) and decided\nwhich choice (1 = true or 0 = false) best described them. We com-\nputed scores for each facet by averaging across items. Across both\nwaves, internal consistencies for MPQ facets were high (xt=\n.75\u2013.96, a = .68\u2013.96; Table S1).\nCook-Medley Hostility Scale\nFinally, participants completed the 50-item Cook-Medley Hos-\ntility Scale (CMHS;Barefoot et al., 1989), which measures\ufb01ve\nnarrow maladaptive traits (which we refer to as facets; Wave 1\nN = 1,777; Wave 2N = 393). For each CMHS item, participants\nread a statement (e.g.,\u201cNo one cares much what happens to you\u201d)\nand decided whether it was 1 = true or 0 = false as it applied to\nthem. We computed scores for each facet by averaging across\nitems. Across waves, internal consistencies for CHMS facets were\nacceptable (xt = .52\u2013.82, a = .34\u2013.79), but were low for social\navoidance (xts = .54 and .20,as = .45 and\u2013.06).

Most participants (90% at Wave 1 and 93% at Wave 2)\nwere rated by two close others (A and B). Close others were cho-\nsen by the participant, and they included spouses/partners (30% at\nWave 1 and Wave 2), parents (9%/3%), siblings (12%/11%), other\nclose relatives (12%/21%), close friends (31% at both waves), or\nother (6%/4%). Unfortunately, as close others were not assigned\nIDs, we could not track whether close others differed across\nwaves. However, when close others were asked how well they\nknew the person they were rating (from 1 =not at allto 5 =know\nvery well), 98% of close other As and 92% of close other Bs\nreported knowing the person they were rating eitherwell or very\nwell. Furthermore, self-other correlations between perspectives\nwere similar in magnitude to what has been reported in past\nresearch (Table S2; Oltmanns & Oltmanns, 2021 ). As such,\nalthough close others may have differed across waves, they had\nsubstantial knowledge about the participants they were rating.

Past research has found that this unconventionality facet\nis less internally consistent than other NEO-FFI facets but is none-\ntheless a valid construct, as it demonstrates similar temporal stabil-\nity to other personality facets and reliably predicts outcomes\n(Klimstra et al., 2018; Schwaba et al., 2019).\nIdentifying (Un)Healthy Personality Facets\nWe next classi\ufb01ed personality facets as healthy, unhealthy, or\nneutral. We classi\ufb01ed NEO-PI-R facet scales using ratings col-\nlected byBleidorn et al. (2020), who asked 137 experts on person-\nality psychology to rate the psychologically healthy person in\nterms of the 30 NEO-PI-R facets. This placed each facet on a gra-\ndation of psychological adaptiveness that we used to classify each\nNEO-PI-R facet as healthy (rated as.3.5 on a scale of 1\u20135) or\nunhealthy (rated as,2.5 on a scale of 1\u20135) according to preregis-\ntered standards. Although classi\ufb01cations necessarily simplify this\ngradation, they are necessary for our analyses that require delineat-\ning healthy, unhealthy, and neutral facets. We classi\ufb01ed NEO-FFI\nfacets by matching each facet to the most relevant facet(s) of the\nNEO-PI-R, as all NEO-FFI items were included in the NEO-PI-R.\nWe classi\ufb01ed all CMHS facets as unhealthy, as these are indicators\nof personality dysfunction. Finally, we classi\ufb01ed MPQ facets as\nhealthy or unhealthy using correlations with the MPQ well-being\nfactor found inRushton and Irwing (2008). We classi\ufb01ed facets\nthat correlated. .25 with well-being as healthy, and we classi\ufb01ed\nfacets that correlated, \u2013.25 with well-being as unhealthy.

Finally, we used the MACS effect size\nderived by Nye and Drasgow (2011) to quantify the extent to\nwhich noninvariance biased mean test scores at Wave 2.\nFor most domain and facet scales, we were able to establish\nstrong or partial invariance and there was little bias resulting from\nnoninvariance across waves. Speci\ufb01cally, three of \ufb01ve Big Five\nself-report scales and six of ten Big Five other-report scales met\ncutoffs for strong invariance, and we were able to establish partial\nmeasurement invariance for the remaining scales by relaxing one\nor two cross-wave intercept constraints (Tables S3\u2013S7). On aver-\nage, there was little bias in Wave 2 means caused by differential\nscale functioning (d = j.15j). Regarding the 30 self-reported NEO-\nPI-R facets, 23 met cutoffs for strong invariance, and we were\nable to establish partial invariance for the remaining seven (Tables\nS3\u2013S7).

Finally, for\nthe other-reported NEO-FFI traits, three facets (self-reproach, ac-\ntivity, and goal-striving) met traditional cutoffs for strong invari-\nance across waves, and we were able to establish partial\ninvariance for most other scales. However, in some cases, increase\nin RMSEA mis\ufb01t was still greater than the .01 threshold proposed\nby Cheung and Rensvold (2002). According to the MACS, the\nmean bias in NEO-FFI facet means at Wave 2 compared with\nWave 1 was d = j.35j, representing a medium effect, although\nthese biases differed across facets and were much larger for Non-\nantagonism (d = 1.25) than any other facet (Table S10).\nThese results indicated that Big Five scale scores and facet scale\nscores were meaningfully comparable across the two measurement\nwaves with only small amounts of mean bias. The one exception\nwas that nonantagonism scores reported by close others showed\nevidence for upward bias at Wave 2, which we account for when\ninterpreting development in this scale.\nExamining Age-Graded Maturation\nTo examine whether each trait matured across ages 30 to 70, we\nestimated a series of MSEMs (Sadikaj et al., 2021) as depicted in\nPanel A ofFigure 1.

Yearly 99% percent\nCIs for each trait slope ranged from6.005 to6.008, which means\nthat traits that changed less than .18 standard deviations across\nages 30\u201370 did not change signi\ufb01cantly atp , .01. At the domain\nlevel, Agreeableness increased and Neuroticism decreased, con-\nsistent with the maturity principle, although Conscientiousness\nremained stable. At the facet level, eight of 14 facets classi\ufb01ed as\nunhealthy decreased signi\ufb01cantly, and the remaining six did not\nshow signi\ufb01cant changes over the study period. Six of 18 facets\nclassi\ufb01ed as healthy increased signi\ufb01cantly, and nine did not show\nsigni\ufb01cant changes. Importantly, though, some traits showed mal-\nadaptive developmental trajectories. Three healthy facets (activity,\nsocial potency, and openness to feelings) declined signi\ufb01cantly, on\naverage, over the study period. This provides support for our hy-\npothesis that development in a small number of facets would devi-\nate from the maturity principle.\nWe explored whether the extent to which a facet changed with\nage was correlated with its adaptiveness rating. These analyses\nallowed us to examine, even among traits classi\ufb01ed as (un)healthy,\nif the ones more relevant to maturity changed more with age. Of\nthe 30 NEO-PI-R facets, those that were rated as healthier (accord-\ning to Table 1) underwent greater age-graded increases (r = .43,\np = .018, 95% CI [.07, .68]). These results provided tentative evi-\ndence that trait changes in adulthood were related to maturation.\nAlthough the maturity principle, as articulated in past work,\nposits continual adaptive development with age (e.g.,Roberts &\nNickel, 2017), it is possible that some traits did not show signi\ufb01-\ncant age-graded changes because they were already at or near ideal\n\u201cmature\u201d levels, on average, by age 30. We explored whether this\nwas the case by comparing model-implied average trait scores at\nage 30 (for the traits that did not show signi\ufb01cant maturation) to\npoint estimates for healthy levels of NEO-PI-R facets presented in\nTable 1. This comparison was not preregistered.

Speci\ufb01cally, the unhealthy facet of vul-\nnerability was near its ideal level (2.21) by age 30, as its 95% CI\ncontained this value (Mage30 = 2.16, 95% CI [2.08, 2.23]), and the\nhealthy facet of self-discipline was even higher than its ideal level\n(3.59) by age 30 (Mage30 = 3.67, 95% CI [3.59, 3.75]), as was\naltruism (3.75; Mage30 = 4.03, 95% CI [3.97, 4.06]). Conversely,\nthe 95% CIs for the unhealthy facets of impulsiveness and anxiety\nremained above the point estimates for their healthy ideal levels at\nboth age 30 and 70, and the healthy facets of positive emotions,\ngregariousness, order, and achievement striving remained below\nhealthy ideal levels at both 30 and 70. This suggests that, in some\ncases, facets may have been suf\ufb01ciently mature by age 30, which\nmay explain why they did not show continued change across ages\n30 to 70 in our sample.\nOverall, of 32 facets classi\ufb01ed as (un)healthy, 23 developed in\nadaptive ways consistent with the maturity principle, three devel-\noped maladaptively, and six others were not at mature levels and\ndid not show signi\ufb01cant change with age. Some additional take-\naways from these analyses were that, for each Big Five domain\nbeside Neuroticism, there was a visible fanning-out effect such that\nfacets underlying the same domain showed distinctly different age-\ngraded trajectories (seeFigure 1). Furthermore, for each trait, we\nfound signi\ufb01cant individual differences in change (allps ,.001),\nindicating that adaptive development throughout early and middle\nadulthood was a typical, but not ubiquitous, phenomenon.\nFor each trait, we also estimated linear regressions to describe\nage-graded development across all participants as well as in three\nage cohorts: participants who began the study ages 30\u201339 years,\n40\u201349 years, and 50\u00fe years. Results of these regressions, which\nwe present inFigures S1and S2, recapitulate the\ufb01ndings from the\nMSEMs. For nearly all traits, each age group displayed similar\npatterns of maturation to one another and the overall age-graded\ntrend. However, for a few traits, cohort trajectories differed from\nthe overall age-graded trajectory. Speci\ufb01cally, for the facets of ali-\nenation and achievement, we found a relatively\ufb02at between-per-\nson trajectory from ages 30\u201370 but increases within each of the\nthree age cohorts.

To do this, we saved\nthe slope factor scores for each domain and facet trait derived\nfrom the self-report latent difference score models described above\n(see Figure 1) and estimated the correlations in slope factors\namong all traits. That is, we estimated the between-person covari-\nance in within-person trait change. A full codevelopmental corre-\nlation matrix is available athttps://osf.io/w56ar.\nAt the domain level, results indicated that codevelopment\namong Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness\nwas strong, but not stronger than codevelopment among the\nother Big Five domains (seeFigure 4). Neuroticism, in particu-\nlar, codeveloped strongly with each of the other Big Five\ndomains. Thus, people who changed in one Big Five domain\ntended to change in other domains as well, but comaturation\nwas not discriminable from general codevelopment.\nResults of facet-level analyses were more nuanced (seeFigure 4).\nPersonality facets matured largely independently of one another: The\naverage correlated change among healthy and unhealthy facets was\nrco-dev = j.11j. Codevelopment was similar in magnitude when exam-\nining comaturation among only healthy facets or among only unheal-\nthy facets. Furthermore, codevelopment among healthy and\nunhealthy facets was no stronger, on average, than codevelopment\nbetween (un)healthy facets and neutral facets, or codevelopment\namong just neutral facets, providing no evidence for discriminabil-\nity between comaturation and general codevelopment across facets.\nFinally, we explored codevelopmental patterns among the six\nNEO-PI-R facets underlying each of the Big Five domains, regard-\nless of their adaptivity ratings. On average, the facets of each domain\ncodeveloped more strongly with each other than with facets of other\ndomains (see Figure 4). Additionally, there was relatively strong\ncodevelopment among the 18 total facets underlying Agreeableness,\nConscientiousness, and Neuroticism (Mrchange = j.30j) compared to\nother facet clusters.\nFigure 4\nComaturation Among Personality Facets (N = 393)\nNote.

However, comaturation was not stronger than\ngeneral codevelopment.\nFinally, we examined comaturation using data from self- and\nother-reports of the NEO-FFI traits using the same methodology as\ndescribed above. Results of these models indicated that correlated\nchange among the Big Five was stronger in other-report data than in\nself-report data (seeFigure 5). Furthermore, there was signi\ufb01cant cor-\nrelated change across self- and other-reports for the domains of Neu-\nroticism (r = .21), Extraversion (r = .23), and Conscientiousness (r =\n.18), providing convergent evidence for the validity of domain\nchange over the study period.\nThis pattern of results largely replicated at the facet level. Facets\ncomatured twice as strongly in other-reported data compared with self-\nreport data, indicating that others perceived much tighter comaturation\nthan the self (seeFigure 5). Indeed, the average codevelopment among\nother-rated facets wasr = j.26j, whereas the codevelopment among\nself-rated facets wasjr =. 1 3j. However, self- and other-reports only\nsomewhat agreed on facet-level change, as cross-rater same-trait code-\nvelopmental estimates were signi\ufb01cant for only seven of 14 facets.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we tested three preregistered hypotheses regarding\npersonality trait maturation in adulthood. First, we found strong\nsupport for our hypothesis that most, but not all, personality facets\nwould show adaptive development across midlife. In this sample,\nmost facets changed in the direction of greater psychological ma-\nturity or were already at high levels of maturity at age 30, and only\nthree facets showed maladaptive change across ages 30 to 70. Sec-\nond, contrary to past research, we found more pronounced Big\nFive maturation in other- than self-reports. Third, we found mixed\nevidence for comaturation across the study period: correlated\nchange among (un)healthy facets was small in magnitude and no\ngreater than correlated change among all facets. We next discuss\nthese three sets of results in more detail and conclude by summa-\nrizing the current state of research on personality maturation.\nAge-Graded Personality Maturation\nWe found that most personality traits developed adaptively\nacross ages 30\u201370. Speci\ufb01cally, the Big Five domains of Agree-\nableness and Neuroticism showed adaptive changes, and of the 32\nfacets classi\ufb01ed as healthy or unhealthy, 15 developed adaptively,\nand only three developed maladaptively. At the domain level,\nthese results are consistent with a large body of research that has\nshown age-graded maturation in Agreeableness, Conscientious-\nness, and Neuroticism (Roberts et al., 2006; Roberts & Nickel,\n2017) and provide support for the maturity principle of personality\ndevelopment. At the facet level, these results provide important\nevidence that a wide variety of narrower personality traits linked\nto physical and mental health as well as interpersonal functioning\nFigure 5\nCorrelated Change Among NEO-FFI Domains and Facets Across Self- (N = 393) and Close\nOther- (N = 375) Perspectives\nNote.

Indeed, traits that were\nmore adaptive showed greater age-graded increases, supporting\nthe notion that mean-level personality trait change in adulthood\ncan be summarized, parsimoniously, as a trend toward maturation.\nThough most traits developed adaptively across adulthood, nine\nhealthy traits did not show signi\ufb01cant changes with age. Did these\ntraits fail to mature? Follow-up exploratory analyses suggested\nthat these traits may have already been at healthy levels by age 30,\nwhen the youngest participants began the study, which indicates\nthat these traits may have undergone suf\ufb01cient maturation earlier\nin the life span. However, it is unclear what the ideal mature level\nof a trait is. Research has shown that highly conscientious, agree-\nable, and emotionally stable people generally still desire continued\nincreases in these traits (Hudson et al., 2020), and that associations\nbetween Conscientiousness and positive outcomes hold even\namong high scorers (Roberts & Nickel, 2017), which suggests that\nthere may be no limit to adaptive trait change. Identifying whether\na lack of mean-level change in healthy traits is maladaptive can be\naddressed more precisely in future research that measures the\nentire maturation process from adolescence into later life and links\ntrajectories of maturation to life outcomes.\nIn addition, three healthy facets showed maladaptive age-graded\ndecreases: openness to feelings, social potency, and activity each\ndeclined, on average, across the ages of 30 to 70. This result is\npartly consistent with previous studies on facet-level personality\ndevelopment in adulthood, which also reported decreases in traits\nrelated to social activity, like gregariousness and activity (Bleidorn\net al., 2009; Soto & John, 2012; Terracciano et al., 2005). How-\never, none of these studies found age-graded decreases in facets of\nopenness. So, do these\ufb01ndings refute the maturity principle? The\nanswer here is not straightforward. Our ratings of adaptiveness\nwere derived fromBleidorn et al. (2020), who measured adaptive-\nness without respect to age. Whether a trait is relevant to healthy\nfunctioning likely changes across the life span. As people age and\nexperience major life events such as parenthood, their social net-\nworks tend to decrease in size and become more familial (Wrzus\net al., 2013) and they place less importance on social goals (Athe-\nrton et al., 2020). As such, age-graded declines in activity and\nsocial potency may re\ufb02ect changes in social priorities toward fam-\nily and away from meeting new people, rather than maladaptive\ndevelopment (Roberts et al., 2006).\nRegarding the trait of openness to feelings, which measures a\nperson\u2019s tendency to value and access complex, varied emotions\n(Terracciano et al., 2003), age-graded declines are likely maladap-\ntive, but because no other research has found age-graded decreases\nin this trait, and highly related measures of emotional complexity\noften increase with age (Ready et al., 2012), we hesitate to draw\nstrong conclusions from this result. Absent replicable evidence of\nmaladaptive change in traits that are relevant to healthy function-\ning at all points in the life span, such as anxiety and cooperative-\nness, we do not think that these\ufb01ndings invalidate the maturity\nprinciple. Rather, they add nuance to our understanding of matura-\ntion as a process of continual adaptation to developmental chal-\nlenges that change with age (Erikson, 1959; Loevinger, 1976).\nAs a\ufb01nal point, some of the facets that changed the most with\nage in this study were not especially relevant to maturity, such as\nopenness to fantasy and excitement seeking. These two facets\nalso showed some of the greatest age-graded decreases in past\nresearch ( Bleidorn et al., 2009 ; Terracciano et al., 2005 ).\nDescribing development in traits like these may require compan-\nion principles to the maturity principle of life span development.\nThese principles can expand beyond maturation-based accounts\nto incorporate theories of motivational and biological develop-\nment across adulthood from neighboring \ufb01elds (e.g., selection-\noptimization-compensation meta-theory from life span aging\nresearch; Baltes, 1997).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4226, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1352b0d-98c1-4608-a7f5-7de2cbb2c336": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1352b0d-98c1-4608-a7f5-7de2cbb2c336", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5bbc8273-30bd-4aed-8060-459560c0db01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "6141d762b4057cb02b1bc981c9ccb70587c1e7b373e0151d48769e7d8379f667", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f373d127-cc6c-4c3c-a75a-f3f8a816f822", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "c8bc166b522036a8e927e4ed4babdef90b80466a4c64919bc4ba0a4b403334c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "As a\ufb01nal point, some of the facets that changed the most with\nage in this study were not especially relevant to maturity, such as\nopenness to fantasy and excitement seeking.

Overall, the varied trajectories across\nfacets, even within the same domain, indicate that a wealth of de-\nvelopmental information is lurking at levels below the Big Five.\nFuture research that examines development in narrower traits\nwill thus be useful in re\ufb01ning our understanding of personality\ndevelopment across adulthood.\nMultirater Perspectives on Personality Maturation\nWe compared the average magnitude of personality trait matura-\ntion between self-reports and reports from two close others. We\nfound that, in three Big Five domains and\ufb01ve of 12 NEO-FFI fac-\nets, other-reported development in adaptive traits was more posi-\ntive than self-reported development. This provides evidence that\nthe maturity principle is not an artifact of self-ratings, as close\nothers indeed reported adaptive increases across the Big Five\ndomains and many personality facets. In the language ofHogan\nand Roberts (2004), these results suggest that people matured\nin terms of both self-perceived identity and other-perceived\nreputation.\nThis \ufb01nding stands in contrast to the few other studies that have\ncompared Big Five development across perspectives, which have\nfound less maturation in other-reports compared to self-reports\n(Lenhausen et al., 2020; Oltmanns et al., 2020; Watson & Humric-\nhouse, 2006). One reason for these differing results might be in\nthe type of relationships across studies. In two past studies (Len-\nhausen et al., 2020; Watson & Humrichouse, 2006), close others\nwere romantic partners in relatively new relationships, whereas in\nthis study, only 30% of close others were romantic partners, and,\ngiven the age of this sample, were likely in well-established\nromantic relationships. New romantic relationships may be subject\nto a honeymoon effect, where partners initially have an overly pos-\nitive view of one another that gradually wears off (Watson &\nHumrichouse, 2006). This would downwardly bias healthy devel-\nopment in a way that applies less to long-term relationships and\nother types of relationships such as friendships. More research on\npersonality development in adulthood from the perspective of\nclose others is needed to unravel the discrepancies across these ini-\ntial studies and provide a more diverse evidentiary basis for claims\nof personality maturation across adulthood.\nComaturation Among Personality Facets\nOur third aim was to investigate comaturation among personal-\nity facets. We found that people who changed adaptively in one\nfacet were slightly more likely to experience adaptive change in\nother facets, but this comaturation was no stronger in magnitude\nthan general codevelopment across all facets. This pattern of\nresults provides preliminary evidence that maturation is not a coor-\ndinated, simultaneous process that explains a large proportion of\ndevelopment across traits. Rather, we found that the vast majority\nof adaptive facet change occurred independently of adaptive\nchange in other facets, suggesting that facet development may be\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nSCHWABA, BLEIDORN, HOPWOOD, MANUCK, AND WRIGHT954", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3508, "end_char_idx": 7483, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f3904f8-26a5-48fb-97c4-ae1ddd7cd4f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f3904f8-26a5-48fb-97c4-ae1ddd7cd4f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e39d751d-06f2-4b96-8a7f-0fb4dae9ba98", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "bd06fce4995d5250eea33936e7b3d64828c89e14ad4548536add473f57a3caec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6b25a2d-548e-464d-8733-0fc348c872f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e3e353d0d9a0851a101a4005e8831a83952dd28df67bb10de259609dc79b871", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "better conceptualized as many narrowly-acting processes that\naffect traits in isolation (Soto & John, 2012). Additional studies of\ncodevelopment among healthy, unhealthy, and neutral traits are\nneeded to provide further evidence about the extent of trait\ncomaturation.\nThese results should be considered in light of our decision to\noperationalize maturation in terms of change in (un)healthy traits.\nMaturation is often discussed broadly in terms of change in Agree-\nableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism (Roberts & Nickel,\n2017), which provides an alternate rubric by which to evaluate\nmaturation and comaturation. Indeed, when we explored codevel-\nopment among all 18 NEO-PI-R facets from these three domains\n(regardless of adaptiveness), we found that correlated change was\nstronger than among other clusters of personality facets. These\nresults provide evidence that there may be some common process\nunderlying codevelopment among facets of Agreeableness, Con-\nscientiousness, and Neuroticism regardless of facet adaptivity rat-\nings. A candidate mechanism for this process is serotonergic\nfunctioning (DeYoung et al., 2002; Wright et al., 2019), which has\nbeen linked to these three domains and psychological maturity in\npast research.\nFinally, an interesting trend emerged when we compared coma-\nturation across the perspectives of the self and close others: Close\nothers reported stronger comaturation than the self, as indicated by\nsubstantially higher correlated change across healthy and unhealthy\ntraits. This pattern of\ufb01ndings suggests that close others may view\nadaptive development as a broader and less differentiated process.\nIn other words, change in a person\u2019s reputation may be less nuanced\nthan change in their self-perceptions. Future research is needed to\nreplicate this\ufb01nding, which we did not predict a priori.\nLimitations\nThe present study comes with some important limitations. The\n\ufb01rst concerns the operationalization and measurement of personal-\nity adaptivity. We classi\ufb01ed traits as either healthy, unhealthy, or\nneutral in order to compare development across these three catego-\nries. We acknowledge that, in reality, trait adaptiveness is a contin-\nuous rather than categorical concept, implying that some traits may\nbe more or less healthy than others. Furthermore, our trait classi\ufb01-\ncation was based on empirical correlations with well-being and rat-\nings of the healthy personality. These ratings re\ufb02ect normative,\naverage ratings; however, they cannot capture more unique or idio-\nsyncratic pathways to maturity which may vary across settings,\nindividuals, and developmental stages (Erikson, 1959; Ryff, 1989).\nThe unique strengths of this dataset, such as the longitudinal\nmeasurement of many personality facets from both self- and other-\nperspectives, should be considered alongside its major design limi-\ntations. Speci\ufb01cally, our analyses of maturation were limited by\nour two-wave longitudinal design. Longitudinal models based on\ntwo waves of data provide less reliable and robust estimates of\nchange than those that include three or more measurements (Dun-\ncan et al., 2013). Relatedly, only 401 of the 1,785 participants con-\ntributed two personality measurements. Though our analyses that\ndescribe maturation from age 30 to age 70 incorporate measure-\nments from all participants, the fact that most only contributed one\nwave of data means that between-person age differences in person-\nality played an especially strong role in estimates of age-graded\nchange compared to within-person age changes in personality.\nAn additional limitation of this study is that we did not measure\nwhich other-raters were consistent across measurement waves. At\nboth waves, raters generally knew their targets quite well, and cor-\nrespondence between self- and other-rated personality was similar\nin magnitude to what has been found in past research.

However, this design is different from past research\non other-rated personality development, in which the same close\nothers provided trait ratings at both measurement waves or change\nin raters was controlled for statistically (Lenhausen et al., 2020;\nOltmanns et al., 2020; Watson & Humrichouse, 2006).

Using results from this study and past\nresearch, we close by proposing an expanded maturity principle of\npersonality development. In this list, we describe common\ufb01ndings\nand caveats regarding variation across traits, people, and samples.\nThese caveats underscore how there are few absolutes in personal-\nity development (and behavioral science in general).\n\u0081 Across adulthood, people show increases in a wide spec-\ntrum of broad and narrow traits emblematic of mental and\nphysical health, interpersonal functioning, and productiv-\nity (Caspi et al., 2005). However, not all traits mature\nalike. Even highly correlated traits mature at different\nrates, and in most studies of facet-level development some\nhealthy personality traits show maladaptive declines,\noftentimes those associated with social engagement (e.g.,\nDonnellan et al., 2007; Terracciano et al., 2005).\n\u0081 Adaptive development generally occurs from late adoles-\ncence (e.g.,Klimstra et al., 2018; Luan et al., 2018)u pt o\nthe years preceding death (e.g.,Wagner et al., 2016), with\nchanges that are most pronounced in emerging adulthood\n(ages 18\u201330; Roberts & Davis, 2016). However, in some\nsamples, adaptive development begins earlier in life (e.g.,\nBrandes et al., 2020) and extends into very old age (e.g.,\nMueller et al., 2016).\n\u0081 On average, traits only co-mature within people to a small\nextent, as adaptive development in one trait is mostly inde-\npendent of adaptive development in others (e.g.,Allemand\n& Martin, 2017). Traits that are more strongly associated\ntend to co-mature more strongly (e.g.,Soto & John, 2012).\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nREFINING THE MATURITY PRINCIPLE 955", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3567, "end_char_idx": 7086, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b402018e-07b8-4080-a5c2-512e00de9da1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b402018e-07b8-4080-a5c2-512e00de9da1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5b6c4d59-826a-4b60-a776-d33ca5d81c54", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "demo_4.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/mattfranco/Desktop/walter/walter-v2/psych_pdfs/demo_4.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2702733, "creation_date": "2025-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-21"}, "hash": "a569f1568b75df342f786e8659d81cbb84a96c40e70f9e0df2b8b50c0621378c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c4f06b4-d29b-44fb-a094-e4c63be6ea72", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f811546ac64aea73d2aaca41ca1682de23116f6ee3b60352904c826dc40c4a85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u0081 Early and accumulating evidence suggests that the rates of\nadaptive development in personality traits may differ across\nself- and other-reported perspectives (e.g.,Oltmanns et al.,\n2020).
